0,32342318,Functional Connectomic Approach to Studying Selank and Semax Effects.,"The present study was aimed at the assessment of effects of anxiolytic Selank and nootropic Semax on the whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of each of the predefined regions of interest (ROIs) in 52 healthy participants. The ROIs included amygdala (one of the key regions for the regulation of anxiety) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; the key region for executive functions, including working memory) in the right and left hemisphere. Resting-state fMRI was carried out three times, namely before, after 5 and 20 min of the injection of either Semax, or Selank, or placebo. Between-group alongwith between-condition differences were revealed in FC between the right amygdala and a region in fusiform, inferior and middle temporal as well as parahippocampal gyri in the right hemisphere. Post hoc analysis allowed us to define both general and specific effects of Selank and Semax on FC between the right amygdala and the right temporal cortex for the first time.",2020,Post hoc analysis allowed us to define both general and specific effects of Selank and Semax on FC between the right amygdala and the right temporal cortex for the first time.,['52 healthy participants'],"['Semax, or Selank, or placebo', 'anxiolytic Selank and nootropic Semax']",[],"[{'cui': 'C1708335', 'cui_str': 'Healthy Participants'}]","[{'cui': 'C0141950', 'cui_str': 'semax'}, {'cui': 'C1100112', 'cui_str': 'selank'}, {'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}, {'cui': 'C0040616', 'cui_str': 'Anxiolytic agent'}, {'cui': 'C0242913', 'cui_str': 'Antidementia agent'}]",[],52.0,0.023829,Post hoc analysis allowed us to define both general and specific effects of Selank and Semax on FC between the right amygdala and the right temporal cortex for the first time.,"[{'ForeName': 'Ya R', 'Initials': 'YR', 'LastName': 'Panikratova', 'Affiliation': 'Mental Health Research Center, Moscow, Russia. panikratova@mail.ru.'}, {'ForeName': 'I S', 'Initials': 'IS', 'LastName': 'Lebedeva', 'Affiliation': 'Mental Health Research Center, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'ForeName': 'O Yu', 'Initials': 'OY', 'LastName': 'Sokolov', 'Affiliation': 'Mental Health Research Center, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'ForeName': 'A D', 'Initials': 'AD', 'LastName': 'Rumshiskaya', 'Affiliation': 'Davidovskiy City Clinical Hospital, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'ForeName': 'D A', 'Initials': 'DA', 'LastName': 'Kupriyanov', 'Affiliation': '""Philips"", Moscow, Russia.'}, {'ForeName': 'N V', 'Initials': 'NV', 'LastName': 'Kost', 'Affiliation': 'Mental Health Research Center, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'ForeName': 'N F', 'Initials': 'NF', 'LastName': 'Myasoedov', 'Affiliation': 'Mental Health Research Center, Moscow, Russia.'}]","Doklady biological sciences : proceedings of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, Biological sciences sections",['10.1134/S001249662001007X']
1,32342496,Efficacy and safety of nabiximols cannabinoid medicine for paediatric spasticity in cerebral palsy or traumatic brain injury: a randomized controlled trial.,"AIM


To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oromucosal nabiximols cannabinoid medicine as adjunct therapy for children with spasticity due to cerebral palsy/traumatic central nervous system injury with inadequate response to existing treatment.
METHOD


Overall, 72 patients (mean [SD] age 12y 4mo [3y 1mo], range 8-18y) were randomized at a ratio of 2:1 to receive nabiximols (n=47; 29 males, 18 females) or placebo (n=25; 15 males, 10 females) for 12 weeks (12 sprays/day max. based on clinical response/tolerability). The primary outcome was change from baseline in level of spasticity on a 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), assessed by the primary caregiver at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included additional measures for spasticity, sleep quality, pain, health-related quality of life, comfort, depression, and safety.
RESULTS


There was no significant difference in the spasticity 0 to 10 NRS between nabiximols versus placebo groups after 12 weeks. No statistically significant differences were observed for any secondary endpoint. Adverse events were predominantly mild or moderate in severity; however, three cases of hallucinations were reported.
INTERPRETATION


Nabiximols was generally well tolerated; however, neuropsychiatric adverse events were observed. No significant reduction in spasticity with nabiximols treatment versus placebo was observed.
WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS

Here, we provide the duration of response, splenectomy and mortality rates based on extended follow-up after completion of the RITP study. Extended follow-up data were retrospectively collected for 72 (83%) patients out of the 84 patients who were not splenectomized during the initial RITP study. For the present analysis, median [interquartile range] duration of follow-up after randomization was 72 [62-82] months.

3,32342703,Remote Management of Pacemaker Patients with Biennial In-clinic Evaluation: Continuous Home Monitoring in the Japanese At Home Study - A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Background  - Current expert consensus recommends remote monitoring (RM) for cardiac implantable electronic devices, with at least annual in-office follow-up. We studied safety and resource consumption of exclusive remote follow-up (RFU) in pacemaker patients for two years.  Methods  - In Japan, consecutive pacemaker patients committed to RM were randomized to either RFU or conventional in-office follow-up (CFU) at twice-yearly intervals. RFU patients were only seen if indicated by remote monitoring. All returned to hospital after two years. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, stroke, or cardiovascular events requiring surgery, and the primary hypothesis was non-inferiority with 5% margin.  Results  - Of 1274 randomized patients (50.4% female, age 77±10 years), 558 (RFU) and 550 (CFU) patients reached either the primary endpoint or 24 months follow-up. The primary endpoint occurred in 10.9% and 11.8%, resp. (P=0.0012 for non-inferiority). The median (IQR) number of in-office follow-ups was 0.50 (0.50 - 0.63) in RFU and 2.01 (1.93 - 2.05) in CFU per patient-year (P<0.001). Insurance claims for follow-ups and directly related diagnostic procedures were 18,800 Yen (16,500 - 20,700 Yen) in RFU and 21,400 Yen (16,700 - 25,900 Yen) in CFU (P<0.001). Only 1.4% of remote follow-ups triggered an unscheduled in-office follow-up, and only 1.5% of scheduled in-office follow-ups were considered actionable.  Conclusions  - Replacing periodic in-office follow-ups with remote follow-ups for 2 years in pacemaker patients committed to RM does not increase the occurrence of major cardiovascular events and reduces resource consumption.  Clinical Trial Registration  - The trial was registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov; Unique Identifier: NCT01523704.",2020,"Only 1.4% of remote follow-ups triggered an unscheduled in-office follow-up, and only 1.5% of scheduled in-office follow-ups were considered actionable.

4,32342837,Effect of Mass Treatment with Azithromycin on Causes of Death in Children in Malawi: Secondary Analysis from the MORDOR Trial.,"Recent evidence indicates mass drug administration with azithromycin may reduce child mortality. This study uses verbal autopsy (VA) to investigate the causes of individual deaths during the Macrolides Oraux pour Réduire les Décès avec un Oeil sur la Résistance (MORDOR) trial in Malawi. Cluster randomization was performed as part of MORDOR. Biannual household visits were conducted to distribute azithromycin or placebo to children aged 1-59 months and update the census to identify deaths for VA. MORDOR was not powered to investigate mortality effects at individual sites, but the available evidence is presented here for hypothesis generation regarding the mechanism through which azithromycin may reduce child mortality. Automated VA analysis was performed to infer the likely cause of death using two major analysis programs, InterVA and SmartVA. A total of 334 communities were randomized to azithromycin or placebo, with more than 130,000 person-years of follow-up. During the study, there were 1,184 deaths, of which 1,131 were followed up with VA. Mortality was 9% lower in azithromycin-treated communities than in placebo communities (rate ratio 0.91 [95% CI: 0.79-1.05];  P  = 0.20). The intention-to-treat analysis by cause using InterVA suggested fewer HIV/AIDS deaths in azithromycin-treated communities (rate ratio 0.70 [95% CI: 0.50-0.97];  P  = 0.03) and fewer pneumonia deaths (rate ratio 0.82 [95% CI: 0.60-1.12];  P  = 0.22). The use of the SmartVA algorithm suggested fewer diarrhea deaths (rate ratio 0.71 [95% CI: 0.51-1.00];  P  = 0.05) and fewer pneumonia deaths (rate ratio 0.58 [95% CI: 0.33-1.00];  P  = 0.05). Although this study is not able to provide strong evidence, the data suggest that the mortality reduction during MORDOR in Malawi may have been due to effects on pneumonia and diarrhea or HIV/AIDS mortality.",2020,Mortality was 9% lower in azithromycin-treated communities than in placebo communities (rate ratio 0.91 [95% CI: 0.79-1.05];  P  = 0.20).,"['A total of 334 communities', 'Children in Malawi']","['azithromycin', 'Azithromycin', 'azithromycin or placebo']","['child mortality', 'pneumonia deaths', 'Causes of Death', 'Mortality', 'diarrhea deaths']","[{'cui': 'C0439810', 'cui_str': 'Total'}, {'cui': 'C4517729', 'cui_str': '334'}, {'cui': 'C0009462', 'cui_str': 'Community'}, {'cui': 'C0008059', 'cui_str': 'Child'}, {'cui': 'C0024548', 'cui_str': 'Malawi'}]","[{'cui': 'C0052796', 'cui_str': 'Azithromycin'}, {'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}]","[{'cui': 'C0008083', 'cui_str': 'Mortality, Child'}, {'cui': 'C0032285', 'cui_str': 'Pneumonia'}, {'cui': 'C0011065', 'cui_str': 'Death'}, {'cui': 'C0007465', 'cui_str': 'Cause of death'}, {'cui': 'C0026565', 'cui_str': 'Mortality rate'}, {'cui': 'C0011991', 'cui_str': 'Diarrhea'}]",334.0,0.538584,Mortality was 9% lower in azithromycin-treated communities than in placebo communities (rate ratio 0.91 [95% CI: 0.79-1.05];  P  = 0.20).,"[{'ForeName': 'John D', 'Initials': 'JD', 'LastName': 'Hart', 'Affiliation': 'London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'ForeName': 'Khumbo', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Kalua', 'Affiliation': 'Blantyre Institute for Community Outreach and College of Medicine, University of Malawi, Blantyre, Malawi.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jeremy D', 'Initials': 'JD', 'LastName': 'Keenan', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Francis I.

5,32342840,Cost-Effectiveness of Mass Treatment with Azithromycin for Reducing Child Mortality in Malawi: Secondary Analysis from the MORDOR Trial.,"The recent Macrolides Oraux pour Réduire les Décès avec un Oeil sur la Résistance (MORDOR) trial reported a reduction in child mortality following biannual azithromycin mass drug administration (MDA). Here, we investigate the financial costs and cost-effectiveness from the health provider perspective of azithromycin MDA at the MORDOR-Malawi study site. During MORDOR, a cluster-randomized trial involving biannual azithromycin MDA or placebo to children aged 1-59 months, fieldwork-related costs were collected, including personnel, transport, consumables, overheads, training, and supervision. Mortality rates in azithromycin- and placebo-treated clusters were calculated overall and for the five health zones of Mangochi district. These were used to estimate the number needed to treat to avert one death and the costs per death and disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. The cost per dose of MDA was $0.74 overall, varying between $0.63 and $0.94 in the five zones. Overall, the number needed to treat to avert one death was 1,213 children; the cost per death averted was $898.47, and the cost per DALY averted was $9.98.

6,32342841,Effects of Biannual Azithromycin Mass Drug Administration on Malaria in Malawian Children: A Cluster-Randomized Trial.,"Reductions in malaria morbidity have been reported following azithromycin mass drug administration (MDA) for trachoma. The recent MORDOR trial reported a reduction in child mortality following biannual azithromycin MDA. Here, we investigate the effects of azithromycin MDA on malaria at the MORDOR-Malawi study site. A cluster-randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, with 15 clusters per arm, was conducted. House-to-house census was updated biannually, and azithromycin or placebo syrup was distributed to children aged 1-59 months for a total of four biannual distributions. At baseline, 12-month, and 24-month follow-up visits, a random sample of 1,200 children was assessed for malaria with thick and thin blood smears and hemoglobin measurement. In the community-level analysis, there was no difference in the prevalence of parasitemia (1.0% lower in azithromycin-treated communities; 95% CI: -8.2 to 6.1), gametocytemia (0.7% lower in azithromycin-treated communities; 95% CI: -2.8 to 1.5), or anemia (1.7% lower in azithromycin-treated communities; 95% CI: -8.1 to 4.6) between placebo and azithromycin communities. Further interrogation of the data at the individual level per-protocol, including only those who received treatment 6 months previously, and by intention-to-treat did not identify differences in parasitemia between treatment arms.

7,32342846,Impact of Intermittent Mass Testing and Treatment on Incidence of Malaria Infection in a High Transmission Area of Western Kenya.,"Progress with malaria control in western Kenya has stagnated since 2007. Additional interventions to reduce the high burden of malaria in this region are urgently needed. We conducted a two-arm, community-based, cluster-randomized, controlled trial of active case detection and treatment of malaria infections in all residents mass testing and treatment (MTaT) of 10 village clusters (intervention clusters) for two consecutive years to measure differences in the incidence of clinical malaria disease and malaria infections compared with 20 control clusters where MTaT was not implemented. All residents of intervention clusters, irrespective of history of fever or other malaria-related symptoms, were tested three times per year before the peak malaria season using malaria rapid diagnostic tests. All positive cases were treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. The incidence of clinical malaria was measured through passive surveillance, whereas the cumulative incidence of malaria infection was measured using active surveillance in a cohort comprising randomly selected residents. The incidence of clinical malaria was 0.19 cases/person-year (p-y, 95% CI: 0.13-0.28) in the intervention arm and 0.24 cases/p-y (95% CI: 0.15-0.39) in the control arm (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.79, 95% CI: 0.61-1.02). The cumulative incidence of malaria infections was similar between the intervention (2.08 infections/p-y, 95% CI: 1.93-2.26) and control arms (2.19 infections/p-y, 95% CI: 2.02-2.37) with a crude IRR of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.87-1.04).

We evaluated three dosing regimens of the investigational tetravalent AS03 B -adjuvanted dengue-purified inactivated vaccine (DPIV + AS03 B ). In this phase 1/2, observer-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT02421367), 140 healthy adults were randomized 1:1:2 to receive DPIV + AS03 B  according to the following regimens: 0-1 month (M), 0-1-6 M, or 0-3 M. Participants received DPIV + AS03 B  or placebo at M0, M1, M3, and M6 according to their dosing schedule. Primary objectives were 1) to evaluate the safety of DPIV + AS03 B  for 28 days (D) after each dose; 2) to demonstrate the added value of a booster dose (0-1-6 M versus 0-1 M) based on neutralizing antibody titers to each DENV type (DENV-1-4) at 28 D after the last dose; and, if this objective was met, 3) to demonstrate the benefit of a longer interval between the first and second doses (0-1 M versus 0-3 M). Adverse events (AEs) within 7 D after vaccination tended to be more frequent after DPIV + AS03 B  doses than placebo; the number of grade 3 AEs was low (≤ 4.5% after DPIV + AS03 B ; ≤ 2.9% after placebo), with no obvious differences across groups. Within 28 D following each dose, the frequency of unsolicited AEs after DPIV + AS03 B  appeared higher for three-dose (0-1-6 M) than two-dose (0-1 M and 0-3 M) regimens. No serious AEs were considered related to vaccination, and no potential immune-mediated diseases were reported during the study. All three schedules were well tolerated.

9,32342857,Two speeds of increasing milk feeds for very preterm or very low-birthweight infants: the SIFT RCT.,"BACKGROUND


Observational data suggest that slowly advancing enteral feeds in preterm infants may reduce necrotising enterocolitis but increase late-onset sepsis. The Speed of Increasing milk Feeds Trial (SIFT) compared two rates of feed advancement.
OBJECTIVE


To determine if faster (30 ml/kg/day) or slower (18 ml/kg/day) daily feed increments improve survival without moderate or severe disability and other morbidities in very preterm or very low-birthweight infants.
DESIGN


This was a multicentre, two-arm, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial. Randomisation was via a web-hosted minimisation algorithm. It was not possible to safely and completely blind caregivers and parents.
SETTING


The setting was 55 UK neonatal units, from May 2013 to June 2015.
PARTICIPANTS


The participants were infants born at < 32 weeks' gestation or a weight of < 1500 g, who were receiving < 30 ml/kg/day of milk at trial enrolment.
INTERVENTIONS


When clinicians were ready to start advancing feed volumes, the infant was randomised to receive daily feed increments of either 30 ml/kg/day or 18 ml/kg/day. In total, 1400 infants were allocated to fast feeds and 1404 infants were allocated to slow feeds.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES


The primary outcome was survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months of age, corrected for gestational age. The secondary outcomes were mortality; moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months corrected for gestational age; death before discharge home; microbiologically confirmed or clinically suspected late-onset sepsis; necrotising enterocolitis (Bell's stage 2 or 3); time taken to reach full milk feeds (tolerating 150 ml/kg/day for 3 consecutive days); growth from birth to discharge; duration of parenteral feeding; time in intensive care; duration of hospital stay; diagnosis of cerebral palsy by a doctor or other health professional; and individual components of the definition of moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability.
RESULTS


The results showed that survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months occurred in 802 out of 1224 (65.5%) infants allocated to faster increments and 848 out of 1246 (68.1%) infants allocated to slower increments (adjusted risk ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.01). There was no significant difference between groups in the risk of the individual components of the primary outcome or in the important hospital outcomes: late-onset sepsis (adjusted risk ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.07) or necrotising enterocolitis (adjusted risk ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.16). Cost-consequence analysis showed that the faster feed increment rate was less costly but also less effective than the slower rate in terms of achieving the primary outcome, so was therefore found to not be cost-effective. Four unexpected serious adverse events were reported, two in each group. None was assessed as being causally related to the intervention.
LIMITATIONS


The study could not be blinded, so care may have been affected by knowledge of allocation. Although well powered for comparisons of all infants, subgroup comparisons were underpowered.
CONCLUSIONS


No clear advantage was identified for the important outcomes in very preterm or very low-birthweight infants when milk feeds were advanced in daily volume increments of 30 ml/kg/day or 18 ml/kg/day. In terms of future work, the interaction of different milk types with increments merits further examination, as may different increments in infants at the extremes of gestation or birthweight.

10,32342883,Safety Voice for Ergonomics (SAVE): Evaluation of a masonry apprenticeship training program.,"BACKGROUND


Masons have a high rate of musculoskeletal disorders among construction workers and greater than all other industries. Viable solutions to musculoskeletal hazards have been identified by industry stakeholders, yet masons receive minimal ergonomics training. Apprentices, as the next generation of masons, need training and strategies to identify and speak up about ergonomic and safety issues on job sites. To fill this gap, our team developed the Safety Voice for Ergonomics (SAVE) training program.
METHODS


The interactive, 7-unit SAVE program was developed specifically for masonry brick and block apprentices. This innovative training contains detailed ergonomics lessons focusing on risk factors and solutions specific to this masonry craft. It also contains lessons that provide communication and problem solving strategies. Evaluation of SAVE employed a randomized control trial designed to assess the effectiveness of SAVE for apprentices over a six-month period.
RESULTS


Our findings demonstrated that compared to controls, SAVE trained apprentices used their safety voice more (P = .049) and had greater safety participation (P = .028). They adopted more ergonomic practices such as adjusting scaffolding (P = .016) and using better body postures (P = 042). Apprentices liked SAVE and indicated that it prompted them to change workplace safety behaviors.
CONCLUSIONS


SAVE is an effective program, providing needed ergonomic and safety communication training for workers as they begin their trade. The broad adoption of SAVE training by the masonry industry has the potential to empower apprentices, elevate the trade's safety culture, and ultimately reduce musculoskeletal disorders.",2020,"Our findings demonstrated that compared to controls, SAVE trained apprentices used their safety voice more (P = .049) and had greater safety participation (P = .028).",[],"['masonry apprenticeship training program', 'Safety Voice for Ergonomics (SAVE']","['safety participation', 'safety voice']",[],"[{'cui': 'C0040607', 'cui_str': 'Training Programs'}, {'cui': 'C0036043', 'cui_str': 'Safety'}, {'cui': 'C0042939', 'cui_str': 'Voice'}, {'cui': 'C0086246', 'cui_str': 'Human Engineering'}]","[{'cui': 'C0036043', 'cui_str': 'Safety'}, {'cui': 'C0042939', 'cui_str': 'Voice'}]",,0.0168498,"Our findings demonstrated that compared to controls, SAVE trained apprentices used their safety voice more (P = .049) and had greater safety participation (P = .028).","[{'ForeName': 'Jennifer A', 'Initials': 'JA', 'LastName': 'Hess', 'Affiliation': 'Labor Education and Research Center, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, USA.

In this study, we examine decision quality and visual information foraging for DSSs with different known reliability levels. Thirty-six participants completed a financial fraud detection task, first unsupported and then supported by a DSS which highlighted important information sources. Participants were randomly allocated to four cohorts, being informed that the system's reliability was 100%, 90%, 80% or undisclosed. Results showed that only a DSS known to be 100% reliable resulted in participants systematically following its suggestions, increasing the percentage of correct classifications to a median of 100% while halving both, decision time and number of visually attended information sources. In all other conditions, the DSS had no effect on most visual sampling metrics, while decision quality of the human-DSS team was below the reliability level of the DSS.

12,32343000,Randomised clinical trial: faecal microbiota transplantation versus autologous placebo administered via colonoscopy in irritable bowel syndrome.,"BACKGROUND


Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been associated with microbial dysbiosis.
AIM


To investigate the efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in the treatment of IBS.
METHODS


Forty-nine IBS patients were randomised to receive autologous or allogenic FMT via colonoscopy. The primary endpoint was a sustained, minimum of 50-point, reduction in the IBS Symptom Severity Score. The secondary outcomes were levels of anxiety and depression, changes in quality of life, gut microbiota and faecal water content as assessed with validated questionnaires, intestinal microbiota composition and stool dry weight.
RESULTS


The primary endpoint was not achieved in either group. However, there was a transient reduction in the mean IBS Symptom Severity Score in the FMT group at 12 weeks after treatment as compared to baseline (P = 0.01). The groups did not differ in the number of patients achieving clinical response at 12 weeks. In the FMT-treated patients, microbial composition had changed to resemble that of the donor and the stool water content decreased significantly compared to baseline. The depression score decreased in patients with a reduction in IBS symptoms after FMT, but not in those placebo-treated patients who experienced a reduction in IBS symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS


FMT provided only a transient relief of symptoms, although it induced a sustained alteration in the microbiota of IBS patients. Therefore, FMT delivered by a single infusion via colonoscopy cannot be recommended as a treatment for IBS in clinical practice.

13,32343001,Randomised clinical trial: the effectiveness of Gaviscon Advance vs non-alginate antacid in suppression of acid pocket and post-prandial reflux in obese individuals after late-night supper.,"BACKGROUND


Late-night supper increases the risk of postprandial reflux from the acid pocket especially in obesity. An alginate-based, raft-forming medication may be useful for obese patients with GERD.
AIMS


To compare the efficacy of Gaviscon Advance (Reckitt Benckiser, UK) and a non-alginate antacid in post-supper suppression of the acid pocket and post-prandial reflux among obese participants.
METHODS


Participants underwent 48 h wireless and probe-based pH-metry recording of the acid pocket and lower oesophagus, respectively, and were randomised to single post-supper (10 pm) dose of either Gaviscon Advance or a non-alginate antacid on the second night. Primary outcomes were suppression of median pH of acid pocket and lower oesophagus, measured every 10-minutes post-supper for 1 h. Secondary outcomes were suppression of % time pH < 4 at lower oesophagus and improvement in frequency and visual analogue score (VAS) of regurgitation.
RESULTS


Of the 81 screened participants, 55 were excluded and 26 (mean age 33.5 years, males 77.8% and BMI 32.8 kg/m 2  ) were randomised to Gaviscon Advance (n = 13) or antacid (n = 13). Median pH of the acid pocket but not the lower oesophagus was suppressed with Gaviscon Advance vs antacid (all P < 0.04) Gaviscon Advance but not antacid significantly reduced in % time pH < 4, symptom frequency and VAS on day 2 vs day 1 (all P < 0.05).

15,32343035,Comparison of lumbar segmental stabilization and general exercises on clinical and radiologic criteria in grade-I spondylolisthesis patients: A double-blind randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVES


The effects of different physiotherapy protocols on patients suffering from grade-I spondylolisthesis have been thus far examined in a limited number of clinical trials. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to compare the effects of lumbar segmental stabilization and general exercises on clinical and radiologic criteria in grade-I spondylolisthesis patients.
METHODS


This study was a double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a test-retest design and parallel groups. A total of 26 patients with grade-I spondylolisthesis were thus randomly assigned to experimental group (13 patients, lumbar segmental stabilization exercises) and control group (13 patients, general exercises). Subsequently, pain, functional disability, kinesiophobia, translational motion, angular motion and slip percentage of the vertebra were investigated.
RESULTS


Of the 120 people recruited in this study, only 26 patients were eligible. According to pre/post-intervention comparison, a statistically significant decrease was observed in the experimental group in terms of pain (p = 0.000), functional disability (p = 0.004), kinesiophobia (p = 0.002), translational motion (p = 0.043) and angular motion (p = 0.011), but not for slip percentage (p = 0.122). Considering the control group, a statistically significant decline was reported for pain (p = 0.043) and functional disability (p = 0.002). However, no significant differences were found for other variables in the control group. With regard to inter-group comparison, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding the given variables except for kinesiophobia (p = 0.040).

17,32343080,"Associations among body mass index, sedentary behavior, physical activity, and academic performance in schoolchildren.","BACKGROUND


Physical inactivity and sedentary behavior are common among middle and high school grade children. This study aimed to determine the relationship among body mass index (BMI), sedentary behavior, physical activity (PA), and overall academic performance of students.
METHODS


This is a cross section study; three hundred and fifty-seven students of mean age 12.65±1.68 years were enrolled. PA was subjectively assessed using the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children (PAQ-C) and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ). Sedentary behavior was assessed as hours spent on watching television, playing video games, computer use, and homework. Grade point average (GPA) was calculated to determine their overall academic performance. Participants were divided into two groups based on their GPA. Independent t-test was used to analyze BMI, sedentary time, and PA between the groups. Correlation analysis was performed to determine the associations among BMI, sedentary time, physical activity, and academic grades.
RESULTS


There was no significant difference in BMI and the level of PA between the two groups. However, significant differences were observed in sedentary time spent watching television (p=0.04), total screen time (p=0.02), and total sedentary time (p=0.002). There were weak negative correlations among BMI (r=-0.14, p<0.05), total screen time (r=-0.12, p<0.05), and academic scores; however, there was no association with any PA measures.
CONCLUSIONS


A weak correlation was noted between BMI and sedentary characteristics, with respect to academic performance. As academic performance is negatively associated with body mass index and screen time, public health interventions are needed to reduce their time spent on leisure time sedentary activity, watching television, and computer use.",2020,"However, significant differences were observed in sedentary time spent watching television (p=0.04), total screen time (p=0.02), and total sedentary time (p=0.002).","['schoolchildren', 'middle and high school grade children', ' three hundred and fifty-seven students of mean age 12.65±1.68 years were enrolled']",[],"['BMI and the level of PA', 'Grade point average (GPA', 'Sedentary behavior', 'total screen time', 'BMI', 'BMI, sedentary time, physical activity, and academic grades', 'total sedentary time', 'body mass index, sedentary behavior, physical activity, and academic performance', 'Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children (PAQ-C) and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ', 'BMI, sedentary time, and PA', 'body mass index (BMI), sedentary behavior, physical activity (PA), and overall academic performance of students', 'sedentary time spent watching television']","[{'cui': 'C0227972', 'cui_str': 'Structure of median lobe of prostate'}, {'cui': 'C0205250', 'cui_str': 'High'}, {'cui': 'C0036375', 'cui_str': 'School'}, {'cui': 'C0441800', 'cui_str': 'Grade'}, {'cui': 'C0008059', 'cui_str': 'Child'}, {'cui': 'C4517735', 'cui_str': '350'}, {'cui': 'C0205453', 'cui_str': '7'}, {'cui': 'C0038492', 'cui_str': 'Student'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}]",[],"[{'cui': 'C0005893', 'cui_str': 'Body mass index'}, {'cui': 'C0441889', 'cui_str': 'Levels'}, {'cui': 'C0015259', 'cui_str': 'Exercise'}, {'cui': 'C0441800', 'cui_str': 'Grade'}, {'cui': 'C1532253', 'cui_str': 'Sedentary lifestyle'}, {'cui': 'C0439810', 'cui_str': 'Total'}, {'cui': 'C4704787', 'cui_str': 'Screen Time'}, {'cui': 'C0205254', 'cui_str': 'Inactive'}, {'cui': 'C0040223', 'cui_str': 'Time'}, {'cui': 'C0036373', 'cui_str': 'Academic Test Performance'}, {'cui': 'C0034394', 'cui_str': 'Questionnaires'}, {'cui': 'C0008059', 'cui_str': 'Child'}, {'cui': 'C0086542', 'cui_str': 'Leisure'}, {'cui': 'C0282416', 'cui_str': 'Overall'}, {'cui': 'C0038492', 'cui_str': 'Student'}, {'cui': 'C0039461', 'cui_str': 'Television'}]",357.0,0.0167728,"However, significant differences were observed in sedentary time spent watching television (p=0.04), total screen time (p=0.02), and total sedentary time (p=0.002).","[{'ForeName': 'Adel A', 'Initials': 'AA', 'LastName': 'Alhusaini', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Syamala', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Buragadda', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia - syamala3110@yahoo.co.in.'}, {'ForeName': 'Ganeswara R', 'Initials': 'GR', 'LastName': 'Melam', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.'}]",The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness,['10.23736/S0022-4707.20.10482-1']
18,32343081,Muscular morphological adaptations of two whole-body high intensity interval training (HIIT) configurations.,"BACKGROUND


High-intensity intermittent training (HIIT) has increased in popularity due to being time-efficient mode of exercise. Previous HIIT studies have mainly focused on percentage of fat loss, fat mass loss, and weight loss. However, enhancing muscle protein synthesis induced by HIIT that results in muscular morphological adaptations is a potential benefit of HIIT. This study compared the effects of two HIIT protocols on muscular morphological adaptations.
METHODS


Thirty-four recreationally active participants were randomly assigned to 10-5-HIIT and 20- 10-HIIT to complete 6 sets of 6 intervals. The 10-5-HIIT and 20-10-HIIT protocols were performed with 10s:5s and 20s:10s exercise-to-rest ratios and provided with 1- and 2-min recovery periods between sets, respectively. Muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) and echo intensity (EI) of the rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis (VL) were assessed via B-mode ultrasonography before and after intervention. Two-way mixed factorial ANOVAs were used for analyses.
RESULTS


The 10-5-HIIT and 20-10-HIIT groups significantly (p < 0.05) increased RF mCSA (change (Δ) = 0.4 ± 0.8 cm2, 8.0%; Δ = 0.5 ± 0.8 cm2, 5.5%) and VL mCSA (Δ = 1.2 ± 1.6 cm2, 9.0%; Δ = 2.20 ± 1.4 cm2, 10.4%), respectively. No significant (p > 0.05) change was observed for the EI of the RF and VL.
CONCLUSIONS


Whole-body HIIT can be a time-efficient exercise modality to elicit muscular morphological adaptations in the RF and VL muscles. The 10-5-HIIT protocol induced benefits comparable to those of the 20-10-HIIT, while it reduced the total exercise time by 50%.",2020,"The 10-5-HIIT and 20-10-HIIT groups significantly (p < 0.05) increased RF mCSA (change (Δ) = 0.4 ± 0.8 cm2, 8.0%; Δ = 0.5 ± 0.8 cm2, 5.5%) and VL mCSA (Δ = 1.2 ± 1.6 cm2, 9.0%; Δ = 2.20 ± 1.4 cm2, 10.4%), respectively.",['Thirty-four recreationally active participants'],"['two whole-body high intensity interval training (HIIT) configurations', 'High-intensity intermittent training (HIIT']","['Muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) and echo intensity (EI) of the rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis (VL', 'fat loss, fat mass loss, and weight loss', 'RF mCSA', 'total exercise time']","[{'cui': 'C3816446', 'cui_str': '30'}, {'cui': 'C0205177', 'cui_str': 'Active'}]","[{'cui': 'C0229960', 'cui_str': 'Entire body as a whole'}, {'cui': 'C4277545', 'cui_str': 'High-intensity interval training'}, {'cui': 'C4081854', 'cui_str': 'High intensity'}, {'cui': 'C0205267', 'cui_str': 'Intermittent'}, {'cui': 'C0040607', 'cui_str': 'Training Programs'}, {'cui': 'C0449830', 'cui_str': 'With configuration'}]","[{'cui': 'C0026845', 'cui_str': 'Muscle tissue'}, {'cui': 'C0010362', 'cui_str': 'Cross Sectional Analysis'}, {'cui': 'C0017446', 'cui_str': 'Geographic Locations'}, {'cui': 'C0013520', 'cui_str': 'Doppler Echocardiography'}, {'cui': 'C0522510', 'cui_str': 'With intensity'}, {'cui': 'C0584894', 'cui_str': 'Rectus femoris muscle structure'}, {'cui': 'C0015677', 'cui_str': 'Fat'}, {'cui': 'C0577559', 'cui_str': 'Mass of body structure'}, {'cui': 'C1262477', 'cui_str': 'Weight decreased'}, {'cui': 'C0429931', 'cui_str': 'Total exercise time'}]",34.0,0.0221676,"The 10-5-HIIT and 20-10-HIIT groups significantly (p < 0.05) increased RF mCSA (change (Δ) = 0.4 ± 0.8 cm2, 8.0%; Δ = 0.5 ± 0.8 cm2, 5.5%) and VL mCSA (Δ = 1.2 ± 1.6 cm2, 9.0%; Δ = 2.20 ± 1.4 cm2, 10.4%), respectively.","[{'ForeName': 'Masoud', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Moghaddam', 'Affiliation': 'Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA - masoud.moghaddam@okstate.edu.'}, {'ForeName': 'Carlos A', 'Initials': 'CA', 'LastName': 'Estrada', 'Affiliation': 'Aurora University, Aurora, IL, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Timothy', 'Initials': 'T', 'LastName': 'Baghurst', 'Affiliation': 'Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Bert H', 'Initials': 'BH', 'LastName': 'Jacobson', 'Affiliation': 'Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA.'}]",The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness,['10.23736/S0022-4707.20.10526-7']
19,32343102,OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY ANGIOGRAPHY-GUIDED PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY FOR ACUTE CENTRAL SEROUS CHORIORETINOPATHY.,"PURPOSE


To compare the anatomic results of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA)-guided half-dose photodynamic therapy (PDT) versus indocyanine green angiography (ICGA)-guided PDT in eyes with acute central serous chorioretinopathy.
METHODS


This study is a prospective, single-center, noninferiority, double-masked, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Fifty-one eyes of 45 patients with acute central serous chorioretinopathy were recruited, and randomized to an ICGA-guided group and an OCTA-guided group. The primary outcome measures were the rates of complete subretinal fluid (SRF) resolution at 1 month and 3 months.
RESULTS


Forty-six eyes of 40 patients finished the follow-up and were analyzed. In the OCTA-guided group, the SRF was completely resolved in 13 (56.5%) eyes within 1 month and in 21 (91.3%) eyes within 3 months. In the ICGA-guided group, the SRF was resolved in 16 (69.6%) of the eyes within 1 month and in 22 (95.7%) of the eyes by 3 months. Optical coherence tomography angiography-guided PDT was demonstrated noninferior to ICGA-guided PDT for SRF resolution rate at 3 months (P = 0.016), but not at 1 month (P = 0.311) for acute central serous chorioretinopathy patients. Subretinal fluid did not recur in any of the eyes in the OCTA-guided group, but did recur in 2 eyes (8.7%) of the ICGA-guided group during the 3-month follow-up period.

To describe the implementation process of a nutrition risk screening and assessment guideline for infants with congenital heart disease and to assess the impact of nurses' behavior and the effect on infants' outcomes.
DESIGN


A controlled before-and-after implementation study. The three dimensions of the integrated-Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework were used to assess barriers and promoting factors.
SETTING


Cardiac center at Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China.
PATIENTS


Infants with congenital heart disease (n = 142) and nurses (n = 100).
INTERVENTIONS


Implementation of an evidenced-based nutrition risk screening and assessment guideline.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS


Implementation processes were assessed on nurses' knowledge, attitude, behavior, and compliance of the guideline. Infants' clinical outcomes were evaluated before-and-after the implementation. Knowledge, attitude, and behavior of nurses about nutrition risk screening and assessment increased significantly after implementing the guideline. Nurses' compliance with the recommendations for nutritional risk screening improved significantly on three criteria; assessment of nutritional status stability (p < 0.001), assessment of nutritional status deterioration (p = 0.003), and nutritional assessment among infants with moderate risk and above (p < 0.001). The nurses' compliance with the recommendations for nutrition assessment improved significantly in eight of the 10 criteria (p < 0.001). The proportion of infants receiving comprehensive nutrition assessment when they were first screened with moderate or high nutritional risk were higher in the intervention group (24.3% vs 83.3%; p < 0.001). The accuracy rates of nutrition risk screening were higher in the intervention group (52.9% vs 81.9%; p < 0.001).

Our second aim was to explain this relation by examining empirically and theoretically informed age-related risk factors for low smoking cessation treatment engagement. 136 participants ( M age  = 44.2 years,  SD  = 11.3 years;  age  = 22-64 years) were randomized to 15-weeks of either 1) an exercise intervention ( n  = 72) or 2) a wellness education control condition ( n  = 64). First, a logistic regression analysis was employed to test whether younger adults were more likely than older adults to drop prior to quit date. Next, we assessed whether smoking related health concerns, social expectancies, and/or perceived severity of craving affected the strength of the relation between age and attrition, by adding these three variables to the logistic regression along with age. The logistic regression model indicated that younger age and treatment condition were significantly related to the odds of dropping from treatment prior to the scheduled quit date. Further, health concerns, social expectancies, and/or perceived severity of cravings did not account for the effect of age on pre quit-day attrition.

24,32343246,An Electronic Medication Module to Improve Health Literacy in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND


In primary care, patients play a crucial role in managing care processes and handling drug treatment. A decisive factor for success is their health literacy, and several interventions have been introduced to support patients in fulfilling their responsibility.
OBJECTIVE


The aim of this study is to assess the influence of such an intervention (ie, a medication module) within a patient-led electronic health record on patients' health literacy.
METHODS


We conducted a randomized controlled study among community-dwelling patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients were recruited from primary care practices. After randomization, patients either had access to an internet-based medication module allowing them to store their medication information, look up drug information, and print a medication schedule (intervention group), or they received an information brochure on the importance of medication schedules (control group). After 4-8 weeks, all patients were invited to attend a structured medication review (ie, follow-up visit). Data were collected via questionnaires before the start of the intervention and during the follow-up visit. The main outcome measure was the mean difference in health literacy between baseline and follow-up assessments of patients in the control and intervention groups.
RESULTS


Of 116 recruited patients, 107 (92.2%) completed the follow-up assessment and were eligible for intention-to-treat analyses. Only 73 patients, of which 29 were in the intervention group, followed the study protocol and were eligible for per-protocol analysis. No differences in overall health literacy were observed in either the intention-to-treat or in the per-protocol cohorts. Reasons for a null effect might be that the cohort was not particularly enriched with participants with low health literacy, thus precluding measurable improvement (ie, ceiling effect). Moreover, the success of implementation was considered poor because both the correct application of the study procedure (ie, randomization according to the protocol and dropout of 29 patients) and the actual interaction with the medication module was modest (ie, dropout of 9 patients).
CONCLUSIONS


The conduct of this randomized controlled study was challenging, leaving it open whether inadequate implementation, too short of a duration, or insufficient efficacy of the intervention, as such, contributed to the null effect of this study.

25,32343288,Examining the characteristics of patients who continue participation in vs those who drop out of a PTSD clinical trial.,"BACKGROUND


Patients who drop out of clinical trials examining posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may have different characteristics than patients who continue. These characteristics have never been examined in prior PTSD and attrition trials. Our goal was to examine how demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with PTSD impact attrition in a randomized controlled trial.
METHODS


A total of 18 participants were recruited. Data were collected through questionnaires to assess PTSD, depression, and mood disorders. Fisher's exact test was used to examine the association of various categorical demographic and clinical variables with dropout. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to examine differences in medians.
RESULTS


The median total PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 score was 38 for patients who dropped out and 53 for those who did not. The depression scale total was also lower for the dropout group (7 vs 15). The insomnia index was lower for those who did not remain in the study (15 vs 21).

26,32338946,Changes in physiological reactivity in response to the trauma memory during prolonged exposure and virtual reality exposure therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder.,"OBJECTIVE


A key symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is hyperreactivity to trauma-relevant stimuli. Though physiological arousal is reliably elevated in PTSD, the question remains whether this arousal responds to treatment. Virtual reality (VR) has been posited to increase emotional engagement during prolonged exposure therapy (PE) for PTSD by augmenting imaginal exposures with trauma-relevant sensory information. However, the comparative effects of VR exposure therapy (VRE) have received limited empirical inquiry.
METHOD


Ninety active-duty soldiers with combat-related PTSD participating in a randomized-controlled trial to receive PE, VRE, or a waitlist-control (WL) condition had their physiological reactivity, indexed by galvanic skin response (GSR), to their trauma memories assessed at pre-, mid-, and posttreatment.
RESULTS


Although both VRE and PE conditions showed reduced GSR reactivity to trauma memories from pre- to posttreatment, only the VRE group differed significantly from WL. Across the sample, reductions in GSR were significantly correlated with reductions in self-reported PTSD and anxiety symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS

27,32339032,SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF DDP4-INHIBITORS FOR MANAGEMENT OF HOSPITALIZED GENERAL MEDICINE AND SURGERY PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES.,"Background:  DPP4-inhibitors (DPP4-i) have been shown to be effective for the management of inpatient diabetes. We report pooled data from three prospective studies using DPP4-i in general medicine and surgery patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).  Research Design and Methods:  We combined data from three randomized studies comparing DPP4-i alone or in combination with basal insulin or basal bolus insulin regimen. Medicine (n=266) and surgery (n=319) patients admitted with a blood glucose (BG) between 140 and 400 mg/dl, treated with diet, oral agents or low-dose insulin therapy were included. Patients received DPP4-i alone (n=144), DPP4-i plus basal insulin (n=158) or basal bolus regimen (n=283). All groups received correctional doses with rapid-acting insulin for BG >140mg/dl. The primary endpoint was differences in mean daily BG between groups. Secondary endpoints included differences in hypoglycemia and hospital complications.  Results:  There were no differences in mean hospital daily BG among patients treated with DPP4-i alone (170±37 mg/dl), DPP4-i plus basal (172±42 mg/dl) or basal bolus (172±43 mg/dl), p=0.94; or in the percentage of BG readings within target of 70-180 mg/dl (63±32%, 60±31% and 64±28% respectively, p=0.42). There were no differences in length of stay or complications, but hypoglycemia was less common with DPP4-i alone (2%) compared to DPP4-i plus basal (9%) and basal bolus (10%), p=0.004.

28,32337881,Comparison of Radial Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy versus Ultrasound Therapy in the Treatment of Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy.,"INTRODUCTION


People suffering from rotator cuff tendinopathy exhibit reduced mobility due to pain. The pain and the limited functionality affect negatively the overall quality of life.
AIM


The present study aimed to investigate the intensity of pain, the functionality of the upper limbs and the quality of life of patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy by using two different therapeutic modalities, shockwave and ultrasound, whose outcomes were assessed pre-treatment and post-treatment as well as after a 4-week follow-up.
MATERIALS AND METHODS


Out of the total sample of 115 patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy, 56 patients constituted the shockwave intervention group, 47 patients constituted the therapeutic ultrasound group and 12 patients made up the control group. The self-administered questionnaire “The University of Peloponnese Pain, Functionality and Quality of Life Questionnaire, UoP – PFQ” was used where the intensity of pain, functionality and quality of life of the upper limbs were evaluated on a five-point Likert scale, pre-treatment, post-treatment and at a 4-week follow-up.
RESULTS


The pain intensity was reduced and both the functionality and quality of life were improved after shockwave therapy post-treatment (p<0.001) and at a 4-week follow-up (p<0.001) compared with those found after the treatment. Similar improvements in all three parameters were also observed after ultrasound treatment but the outcomes were not as pronounced as in the shockwave group.
CONCLUSION


Both radial shockwave and ultrasound therapies were found to be effective in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy, the statistical analysis showing that radial shockwave therapy was superior to the ultrasound therapy post-treatment and at the 4-week follow-up.",2019,The pain intensity was reduced and both the functionality and quality of life were improved after shockwave therapy post-treatment (p<0.001) and at a 4-week follow-up (p<0.001) compared with those found after the treatment.,"['patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy', 'group, 47 patients constituted the therapeutic ultrasound group and 12 patients made up the control group', 'Out of the total sample of 115 patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy, 56 patients constituted the', 'Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy']","['radial shockwave and ultrasound therapies', 'Radial Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy versus Ultrasound Therapy', 'shockwave intervention', 'radial shockwave therapy']","['Peloponnese Pain, Functionality and Quality of Life Questionnaire, UoP – PFQ', 'overall quality of life', 'pain intensity', 'functionality and quality of life', 'intensity of pain, functionality and quality of life of the upper limbs']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0085515', 'cui_str': 'Structure of rotator cuff including muscles and tendons'}, {'cui': 'C0151936', 'cui_str': 'Disorder of tendon'}, {'cui': 'C0439745', 'cui_str': 'Grouped'}, {'cui': 'C0041620', 'cui_str': 'Therapeutic ultrasound'}, {'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}, {'cui': 'C0439810', 'cui_str': 'Total'}, {'cui': 'C0370003', 'cui_str': 'Specimen'}, {'cui': 'C4517540', 'cui_str': '115'}]","[{'cui': 'C0442038', 'cui_str': 'Radial'}, {'cui': 'C0041620', 'cui_str': 'Therapeutic ultrasound'}, {'cui': 'C1737238', 'cui_str': 'Extracorporeal shock wave therapy'}, {'cui': 'C0184661', 'cui_str': 'Procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0013216', 'cui_str': 'Drug therapy'}]","[{'cui': 'C0030193', 'cui_str': 'Pain'}, {'cui': 'C0518214', 'cui_str': 'Quality of life satisfaction'}, {'cui': 'C0034394', 'cui_str': 'Questionnaires'}, {'cui': 'C0282416', 'cui_str': 'Overall'}, {'cui': 'C1320357', 'cui_str': 'Pain intensity'}, {'cui': 'C0522510', 'cui_str': 'With intensity'}, {'cui': 'C1140618', 'cui_str': 'Upper limb structure'}]",115.0,0.0194251,The pain intensity was reduced and both the functionality and quality of life were improved after shockwave therapy post-treatment (p<0.001) and at a 4-week follow-up (p<0.001) compared with those found after the treatment.,"[{'ForeName': 'Vasileios', 'Initials': 'V', 'LastName': 'Dedes', 'Affiliation': 'University of Peloponnese, Tripoli, Greece.'}, {'ForeName': 'Konstantinos', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Tzirogiannis', 'Affiliation': 'University of Peloponnese, Tripoli, Greece.'}, {'ForeName': 'Maria', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Polikandrioti', 'Affiliation': 'University of West Attica, Athens, Greece.'}, {'ForeName': 'Ariadni Maria', 'Initials': 'AM', 'LastName': 'Dede', 'Affiliation': 'Absalon University College, Kalundborg, Denmark.'}, {'ForeName': 'Christos', 'Initials': 'C', 'LastName': 'Nikolaidis', 'Affiliation': 'University of Peloponnese, Tripoli, Greece.'}, {'ForeName': 'Athanasios', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Mitseas', 'Affiliation': 'Messinion Therapeutirion, Kalamata, Greece.'}, {'ForeName': 'Georgios I', 'Initials': 'GI', 'LastName': 'Panoutsopoulos', 'Affiliation': 'University of Peloponnese, Tripoli, Greece.'}]",Folia medica,['10.3897/folmed.61.e47916']
29,32338931,Theory-specific patient change processes and mechanisms in different cognitive therapies for depression.,"OBJECTIVE


This study aimed to identify differential patient change processes and mechanisms associated with long-term outcome in exposure-based cognitive therapy (EBCT) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression.
METHOD


We drew on a randomized controlled trial in which 149 patients were randomly assigned to either EBCT or CBT, with the treatments showing comparable efficacy at 12-month follow-up (grosse Holtforth et al., 2019). Based on Doss's (2004) 4-step model of psychotherapy change and using sequential multilevel structural equation models, we tested putative theory-based change processes and mechanisms for both treatments. Specifically, we examined emotional processing and cognitive restructuring during treatment as hypothesized change processes of EBCT and CBT, respectively. Furthermore, as potential change mechanisms during follow-up, we examined theory-relevant mechanisms for each treatment, preselected via multilevel models.
RESULTS


Although the full serial mediational pathways were not supported, EBCT fostered greater during-treatment increases in emotional processing and higher self-efficacy during follow-up than CBT, both of which associated with better long-term depression outcome. Unexpectedly, cognitive restructuring change did not differ between EBCT and CBT. Across both CBT and EBCT, greater during-treatment increases in cognitive restructuring related to lower cognitive-behavioral avoidance and greater self-efficacy across follow-up, which associated with lower long-term depression.
CONCLUSIONS


Results suggest that therapists might improve long-term depression outcome by fostering both emotional processing (via emotion-focused techniques as included in EBCT) and cognitive restructuring (by using general CBT techniques included in both treatments), which operate either directly or through varied treatment-common mechanisms (e.g., greater self-efficacy and reduced cognitive-behavioral avoidance).

30,32338932,Predictors and moderators of treatment outcome in a randomized clinical trial for binge-eating disorder.,"OBJECTIVE


The current study examined predictors and moderators of two interventions for binge-eating disorder (BED).
METHOD


Participants were 112 adults with BED ( M age  = 39.7 ± 13.4 years;  M BMI  = 35.1 ± 13.4 kg/m²; 82% female; 91% Caucasian) randomly assigned to integrative cognitive-affective therapy for BED (ICAT-BED) or guided self-help cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBTgsh). Generalized linear models examined predictors and moderators of objective binge-eating episode (OBE) frequency and OBE abstinence at end-of-treatment (EOT) and 6-month follow-up (FU).
RESULTS


Lower levels of baseline dietary restraint and emotion regulation difficulties predicted greater reductions in OBE frequency at EOT and FU, respectively. At EOT, greater pretreatment self-control predicted greater reductions in OBE frequency in ICAT-BED than CBTgsh ( p s < .05). In addition, low shape/weight overvaluation predicted greater reductions in OBE frequency in ICAT-BED than CBTgsh, whereas high shape/weight overvaluation predicted comparable reductions in OBE frequency across treatments at EOT ( p s < .02). At EOT and FU, greater baseline actual-ideal self-discrepancy predicted significantly greater reductions in OBE frequency in ICAT-BED, than CBTgsh ( p s < .02). No significant predictor or moderator effects were observed for models examining OBE abstinence.
CONCLUSION


This study identified two general predictors and four moderators of BED treatment response. However, only one predictor (actual-ideal self-discrepancy) interacted with treatment type to differentially predict OBE frequencies at both EOT and FU. Altogether, findings suggest that ICAT-BED may confer specific and durable improvements in OBE frequencies among individuals with high actual-ideal self-discrepancy. Therefore, patients demonstrating these characteristics may be more likely to benefit from ICAT-BED. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).",2020,"RESULTS

31,32338940,The relation between mindfulness and perceived partner responsiveness during couples' vulnerability discussions.,"Intimacy develops when a person discloses vulnerability and perceives their partner's response as supportive. However, a published experimental study found that individuals report their partners as less supportive in response to disclosures of specific examples of vulnerability that involve the partner (i.e., partner-inclusive) compared to disclosures that do not involve the partner (i.e., partner-exclusive). This research is an extension of findings from that experimental study and examines how individual differences in mindfulness and disclosure specificity are associated with perceived partner responsiveness during disclosures of partner-inclusive and partner-exclusive vulnerabilities. Cohabiting couples ( N  = 82) were randomly assigned to engage in either partner-inclusive or -exclusive vulnerability discussions. Each couple engaged in 2 video-recorded discussions so that each person took a turn as discloser and responder. Trained coders rated disclosures for specificity (i.e., whether or not the discloser used specific examples). Following each discussion, couples rated perceived partner responsiveness. Hypotheses were tested with multilevel modeling. Findings suggest that individuals perceived their partners' reactions as less responsive when they disclosed specific, partner-inclusive vulnerabilities and their partners had lower mindfulness.

Postoperative pain can cause serious adverse reactions that severely affect postoperative outcome. The present study evaluated the effect of dexmedetomidine (DEX) added to sufentanil in intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) on the relief of pain and inflammatory responses during postoperative recovery of patients undergoing a combined thoracoscopic-laparoscopic esophagectomy (TLE).
METHODS


Sixty patients undergoing TLE were randomly allocated to receive 1 μg/ml of sufentanil alone (Group S) or 1 μg/ml of sufentanil plus 2.5 μg/ml of DEX (Group D) for postoperative intravenous (IV) PCA. Postoperative pain relief, cumulative PCA requirements, inflammatory marker levels, delirium and recovery were assessed.
RESULTS


A joint DEX and sufentanil regimen significantly reduced the area under the curve of numerical rating scores for pain at rest (NRSR) and coughing (NRSC) at 1-48 h postoperatively (P = 0.000) that were associated with lower PCA-delivered cumulative sufentanil consumption and less PCA frequency until 48 h postoperatively (P < 0.05 and P < 0.0001, respectively). The simultaneous administration of DEX and sufentanil significantly reduced plasma IL-6 and TNF-α concentrations and increased IL-10 level (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0003 and P = 0.0345, respectively), accompanied by better postoperative delirium categories and health statuses of patients (P = 0.024 and P < 0.05, respectively). There was no hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression or oversedation in Group D.
CONCLUSION


Patients receiving DEX in addition to IV PCA sufentanil for TLE exhibited better postoperative analgesia, fewer inflammatory responses and lower postoperative delirium categories and better health statuses.",2020,"Patients receiving DEX in addition to IV PCA sufentanil for TLE exhibited better postoperative analgesia, fewer inflammatory responses, and lower postoperative delirium categories and

34,32343445,Changes in cerebral perfusion following a 12-month exercise and diet intervention.,"Overweight and obesity may damage the cerebrovascular architecture, resulting in a significant reduction in cerebral blood flow. To date, there have been few randomized clinical trials (RCT) examining whether obesity-related reductions in cerebral blood flow could be modified by weight loss. Further, it is unknown whether the behavioral intervention strategy for weight loss (i.e., diet alone or diet combined with exercise) differentially influences cerebral blood flow in adults with overweight or obesity. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether a 12-month RCT of exercise and diet increases cerebral blood flow in 125 midlife (Mean age ± SD = 44.63 ± 8.36 years) adults with overweight and obesity. Further, we evaluated whether weight loss via diet combined with aerobic exercise has an added effect on changes in cerebral blood flow compared to weight loss via diet alone and whether there were regionally specific effects of the type of behavioral intervention on cerebral blood flow patterns. Consistent with our predictions, a 12-month diet and exercise program resulting in 10% weight loss increased cerebral blood flow. These effects were widespread and extended throughout frontal, parietal, and subcortical regions. Further, there was some regional specificity of effects for both diet-only and diet combined with exercise. Our results demonstrate that weight-related reductions in cerebral blood flow can be modified by 10% weight loss over the course of 12 months and that interventions involving exercise exposure may provide unique effects on cerebral blood flow compared to interventions involving only diet.",2020,"Consistent with our predictions, a 12-month diet and exercise program resulting in 10% weight loss increased cerebral blood flow.","['125 midlife (Mean age\xa0±\xa0SD\xa0=\xa044.63\xa0±\xa08.36\xa0years) adults with overweight and obesity', 'adults with overweight or obesity']","['diet alone or diet combined with exercise', 'RCT of exercise and diet', 'behavioral intervention', 'weight loss via diet combined with aerobic exercise']","['cerebral blood flow', 'cerebral blood flow patterns', 'weight loss', 'cerebral perfusion']","[{'cui': 'C4319551', 'cui_str': '125'}, {'cui': 'C0026062', 'cui_str': 'Middle-age'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0001675', 'cui_str': 'Adult'}, {'cui': 'C0497406', 'cui_str': 'Overweight'}, {'cui': 'C0028754', 'cui_str': 'Obesity'}]","[{'cui': 'C0012155', 'cui_str': 'Dietary finding'}, {'cui': 'C0205195', 'cui_str': 'Combined'}, {'cui': 'C0015259', 'cui_str': 'Exercise'}, {'cui': 'C0008976', 'cui_str': 'Clinical trial'}, {'cui': 'C0004933', 'cui_str': 'Behavioral therapy'}, {'cui': 'C1262477', 'cui_str': 'Weight decreased'}, {'cui': 'C0001701', 'cui_str': 'Aerobic exercises'}]","[{'cui': 'C0007818', 'cui_str': 'Circulation, Cerebrovascular'}, {'cui': 'C0449774', 'cui_str': 'Patterns'}, {'cui': 'C1262477', 'cui_str': 'Weight decreased'}, {'cui': 'C0006104', 'cui_str': 'Brain structure'}, {'cui': 'C0031001', 'cui_str': 'Perfusion'}]",,0.0250442,"Consistent with our predictions, a 12-month diet and exercise program resulting in 10% weight loss increased cerebral blood flow.","[{'ForeName': 'Chelsea M', 'Initials': 'CM', 'LastName': 'Stillman', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'John', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Jakicic', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Health and Physical Activity, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Renee', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Rogers', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Health and Physical Activity, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Alfonso J', 'Initials': 'AJ', 'LastName': 'Alfini', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Mental Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'J Carson', 'Initials': 'JC', 'LastName': 'Smith', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Kinesiology, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jennifer', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Watt', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Chaeryon', 'Initials': 'C', 'LastName': 'Kang', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kirk I', 'Initials': 'KI', 'LastName': 'Erickson', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.'}]",Psychophysiology,['10.1111/psyp.13589']
35,32343462,Early Data on Long-Term Efficacy and Safety of Inotersen in Patients With Hereditary Transthyretin Amyloidosis: A 2-Year Update From the Open-Label Extension of the NEURO-TTR Trial.,"BACKGROUND


Hereditary transthyretin (hATTR) amyloidosis causes progressive polyneuropathy resulting from transthyretin (TTR) amyloid deposition throughout the body, including peripheral nerves. The efficacy and safety of inotersen, an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of TTR protein production, were demonstrated in the phase 3 NEURO-TTR study in patients with hATTR polyneuropathy. Here, we assess the long-term efficacy and safety of inotersen in an ongoing open-label extension (OLE) study.
METHODS


Patients who completed NEURO-TTR were eligible to enroll in the OLE (NCT02175004). Efficacy assessments included the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 neurophysiologic tests composite score (mNIS+7), Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy questionnaire total score (Norfolk QOL-DN), and the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary score (PCS). Safety and tolerability were also assessed.
RESULTS


Overall, 97% (135/139) of patients who completed NEURO-TTR enrolled in the OLE. Patients who received inotersen for 39 cumulative months in NEURO-TTR and the OLE continued to show benefit; patients who switched from placebo to inotersen in the OLE demonstrated improvement or stabilization of neurologic disease progression by mNIS+7, Norfolk QOL-DN, and SF-36 PCS. No new safety concerns were identified. There was no evidence of increased risk for grade 4 thrombocytopenia or severe renal events with increased duration of inotersen exposure.
CONCLUSION


Inotersen slowed disease progression and reduced deterioration of quality of life in patients with hATTR polyneuropathy. Early treatment with inotersen resulted in greater long-term disease stabilization than delayed initiation. Routine platelet and renal safety monitoring were effective; no new safety signals were observed.",2020,"There was no evidence of increased risk for grade 4 thrombocytopenia or severe renal events with increased duration of inotersen exposure.

36,32343483,Motivational interviewing to improve self-care in heart failure patients (MOTIVATE-HF): a randomized controlled trial.,"AIMS


Self-care, an essential component of heart failure (HF) treatment, is inadequate in most patients. We evaluated if motivational interviewing (MI) (i) improves patient self-care maintenance (primary endpoint; e.g. taking medications), self-care management (e.g. responding to symptoms) and self-care confidence (or self-efficacy) 3 months after enrolment; (ii) changes self-care over 1 year, and (iii) augments patient self-care if informal caregivers are involved.
METHODS AND RESULTS


Parallel randomized controlled trial (1:1:1). A sample of 510 patients (median 74 years, 58% male) and caregivers (median 55 years, 75% female) was randomized to Arm 1 (MI only for patients), Arm 2 (MI for patients and caregivers), or Arm 3 (usual care). The intervention in Arms 1 and 2 consisted of one face-to-face MI session with three telephone contacts. Self-care was evaluated with the Self-Care of HF Index measuring self-care maintenance, management, and confidence. Scores on each scale range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better self-care; ≥70 is considered adequate. At 3 months, self-care maintenance improved 6.99, 7.42 and 2.58 points in Arms 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P = 0.028). Self-care maintenance was adequate in 18.4%, 19.4%, and 9.2% of patients in Arms 1, 2 and 3, respectively (P = 0.016). Over 1 year, self-care maintenance, management, and confidence scores in Arms 1 and 2 were significantly higher than in Arm 3 in several follow-ups. Over 1 year, Arm 2 had the best scores in self-care management.

37,32339499,"Effects of exogenous ghrelin administration and ghrelin receptor blockade, in combination with alcohol, on peripheral inflammatory markers in heavy-drinking individuals: Results from two human laboratory studies.","The ghrelin system has been garnering interest for its role in different neuropsychiatric disorders, including alcohol use disorder (AUD). Accordingly, targeting the ghrelin system is under investigation as a potential novel therapeutic approach. While alcohol provokes the immune system and inflammatory responses, ghrelin has potent immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. The present study aimed to shed light on the ""crosstalk"" between ghrelin and inflammation by examining the effects of exogenous ghrelin administration and ghrelin receptor blockade on peripheral inflammatory markers in the context of two human laboratory studies with alcohol administration. Non-treatment-seeking, heavy-drinking individuals with alcohol dependence, the majority of whom were African American males, were enrolled. In the first randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled human laboratory study, participants underwent two experimental paradigms - an intravenous alcohol self-administration (IV-ASA) and an intravenous alcohol clamp (IV-AC) - each consisting of two counterbalanced sessions (ghrelin, placebo). A loading dose of intravenous ghrelin (3 mcg/kg) or placebo, followed by a continuous ghrelin (16.9 ng/kg/min) or placebo infusion was administered. In the second dose-escalating, single-blind, placebo-controlled human laboratory phase 1b study, participants were dosed with an oral ghrelin receptor blocker (PF-5190457) and underwent an oral alcohol challenge. Repeated blood samples were collected, and plasma concentrations of the following inflammatory markers were measured: C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). During the IV-ASA experiment, significant drug × time interaction effects were observed for IL-6 (F 3,36  = 3.345, p = 0.030) and IL-10 (F 3,53.2  = 4.638, p = 0.006), indicating that ghrelin, compared to placebo, significantly reduced blood concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, while increasing blood concentrations of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. No significant drug × time interaction effects were observed during the IV-AC experiment, possibly because of its much shorter duration and/or smaller sample. Treatment with PF-5190457, compared to placebo, had no significant effect on the inflammatory markers investigated. In conclusion, a supraphysiologic pharmacological challenge with exogenous ghrelin in heavy-drinking individuals produced anti-inflammatory effects in the context of intravenous alcohol administration. On the contrary, ghrelin receptor blockade did not lead to any change in the inflammatory markers included in this study.

38,32339504,Long-term Graft Patency after Off-Pump and On-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass: A CORONARY Trial Cohort.,"BACKGROUND


Randomized controlled trials have compared the early and mid-term prognosis of on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and off-pump CABG. However, the results are controversial, and there is limited information on graft patency and long-term outcomes.
METHODS


Betweeen May 2007 and October 2011, 349 patients were randomized to off-pump or on-pump CABG as part of the CORONARY trial at Fuwai Hospital. The primary outcome was coronary bypass graft patency, which was assessed at a mean of 6.7±1.7 years after surgery by multidetector computed tomography. A secondary endpoint was a composite outcome of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, repeat coronary revascularization, or stroke; mean follow-up was 6.5±1.7 years. Graft patency was compared between the off-pump and on-pump CABG treatment arms in the 206 patients with follow-up computed tomography.
RESULTS


There were 107 patients in the off-pump CABG group and 99 in the on-pump group during the follow-up period. These patients underwent a total of 723 grafts, and the overall rate of graft patency did not differ significantly between the off-pump and on-pump groups (87.4% vs 88.9%, P=0.527). The patency rate of the posterior descending branch was lower than average. Higher incidence of mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction and repeat revascularization was found in the off-pump patients however it did not reach significance.
CONCLUSIONS


There were no statistical differences in graft patency rates in off-pump versus on-pump CABG patients during the long-term follow-up.

39,32339648,Updated efficacy results from the JAVELIN Renal 101 trial: first-line avelumab plus axitinib versus sunitinib in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND


The phase 3 JAVELIN Renal 101 trial (NCT02684006) demonstrated significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) with first-line avelumab plus axitinib vs sunitinib in advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC). We report updated efficacy data from the second interim analysis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS


Treatment-naïve patients with aRCC were randomized (1:1) to receive avelumab (10 mg/kg) intravenously every 2 weeks plus axitinib (5 mg) orally twice daily or sunitinib (50 mg) orally once daily for 4 weeks (6-week cycle). The two independent primary endpoints were PFS and overall survival (OS) among patients with PD-L1+ tumors. Key secondary endpoints were OS and PFS in the overall population.
RESULTS


Of 886 patients, 442 were randomized to the avelumab plus axitinib arm and 444 to the sunitinib arm; 270 and 290 had PD-L1+ tumors, respectively. After a minimum follow-up of 13 months (data cutoff Jan 28, 2019), PFS was significantly longer in the avelumab plus axitinib arm than in the sunitinib arm (PD-L1+ population: hazard ratio [HR] 0.62 [95% CI, 0.490-0.777]; 1-sided P < 0.0001; median 13.8 [95% CI, 10.1-20.7] vs 7.0 months [95% CI, 5.7-9.6]; overall population: HR 0.69 [95% CI, 0.574-0.825]; 1-sided P < 0.0001; median 13.3 [95% CI, 11.1-15.3] vs 8.0 months [95% CI, 6.7-9.8]). OS data were immature (PD-L1+ population: HR 0.828 [95% CI, 0.596-1.151]; 1-sided P = 0.1301; overall population: HR 0.796 [95% CI, 0.616-1.027]; 1-sided P = 0.0392).

40,32276071,Acute alcohol intoxication and expectations reshape the spatiotemporal functional architecture of executive control.,"While the deleterious effects of acute ethyl alcohol intoxication on executive control are well-established, the underlying spatiotemporal brain mechanisms remain largely unresolved. In addition, since the effects of alcohol are noticeable to participants, isolating the effects of the substance from those related to expectations represents a major challenge. We addressed these issues using a double-blind, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled experimental design comparing the behavioral and electrical neuroimaging acute effects of 0.6 vs 0.02 ​g/kg alcohol intake recorded in 65 healthy adults during an inhibitory control Go/NoGo task. Topographic ERP analyses of covariance with self-reported dose expectations allowed to dissociate their neurophysiological effects from those of the substance. While alcohol intoxication increased response time variability and post-error slowing, bayesian analyses indicated that it did not modify commission error rates. Functionally, alcohol induced topographic ERP modulations over the periods of the stimulus-locked N2 and P3 components, arising from pre-supplementary motor and anterior cingulate areas. In contrast, alcohol decreased the strength of the response-locked anterior cingulate error-related component but not its topography. This pattern indicates that alcohol had a locally specific influence within the executive control network, but disrupted performance monitoring processes via global strength-based mechanisms. We further revealed that alcohol-related expectations induced temporally specific functional modulations of the early N2 stimulus-locked medio-lateral prefrontal activity, a processing phase preceding those influenced by the actual alcohol intake. Our collective findings thus not only reveal the mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced impairments in impulse control and error processing, but also dissociate substance- from expectations- related functional effects.",2020,"Functionally, alcohol induced topographic modulation over the periods of the stimulus-locked N2 and P3 event-related potential components, arising from pre- supplementary motor and anterior cingulate areas.",['65 healthy adults during an inhibitory control Go/NoGo task'],['placebo'],['strength of the response-locked anterior cingulate error'],"[{'cui': 'C0686750', 'cui_str': 'Well adult'}, {'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}]","[{'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}]","[{'cui': 'C0175190', 'cui_str': 'Anterior Cingulate Gyrus'}]",65.0,0.0365488,"Functionally, alcohol induced topographic modulation over the periods of the stimulus-locked N2 and P3 event-related potential components, arising from pre- supplementary motor and anterior cingulate areas.","[{'ForeName': 'Farfalla', 'Initials': 'F', 'LastName': 'Ribordy Lambert', 'Affiliation': 'Neurology Unit, Medicine Section, Faculty of Science and Medicine, University of Fribourg, 1700, Fribourg, Switzerland.'}, {'ForeName': 'Corentin A', 'Initials': 'CA', 'LastName': 'Wicht', 'Affiliation': 'Neurology Unit, Medicine Section, Faculty of Science and Medicine, University of Fribourg, 1700, Fribourg, Switzerland.'}, {'ForeName': 'Michael', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Mouthon', 'Affiliation': 'Neurology Unit, Medicine Section, Faculty of Science and Medicine, University of Fribourg, 1700, Fribourg, Switzerland.'}, {'ForeName': 'Lucas', 'Initials': 'L', 'LastName': 'Spierer', 'Affiliation': 'Neurology Unit, Medicine Section, Faculty of Science and Medicine, University of Fribourg, 1700, Fribourg, Switzerland.

42,32339234,Motivational Interviewing to Support Oral AntiCoagulation adherence in patients with non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation (MISOAC-AF): a randomised clinical trial.,"AIMS


We aimed to assess the impact of an educational, motivational intervention on the adherence to oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF).
METHODS AND RESULTS


Hospitalised patients with non-valvular AF who received OAC were randomly assigned to usual medical care or a proactive intervention, comprising motivational interviewing and tailored counseling on medication adherence. The primary study outcome was adherence to OAC at 1-year, which was evaluated according to Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) by OAC regimens and was assessed through nationwide registers of prescription claims. Secondary outcomes included the rate of persistence to OAC, gaps in treatment, and clinical events. A total of 1009 patients were randomised, 500 in the intervention group and 509 in the control group. At 1-year follow-up, 77.2% (386/500) of patients in the intervention group were adherent (PDC>80%), compared with 55% (280/509) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.14-3.75; p < 0.001). Mean PDC±standard deviation was 0.85±0.26 and 0.75±0.31, respectively (p < 0.001). Patients that received the intervention were more likely to persist in their OAC therapy at 1 year (aOR 2.42, 95% CI 1.71-3.41; p < 0.001). Usual medical care was associated with more major (≥3 months) treatment gaps (aOR 2.39, 95% CI 1.76-3.26; p < 0.001). Clinical events over a median follow-up period of 2 years did not differ among treatment groups.
CONCLUSIONS


In patients receiving OAC therapy for non-valvular AF, a multilevel motivational intervention significantly improved medication adherence and rate of therapy persistence, and reduced major gaps in treatment.

43,32339248,Effect of High vs Low Doses of Chloroquine Diphosphate as Adjunctive Therapy for Patients Hospitalized With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Importance


There is no specific antiviral therapy recommended for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In vitro studies indicate that the antiviral effect of chloroquine diphosphate (CQ) requires a high concentration of the drug.
Objective


To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 CQ dosages in patients with severe COVID-19.
Design, Setting, and Participants


This parallel, double-masked, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial with 81 adult patients who were hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was conducted from March 23 to April 5, 2020, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon.
Interventions


Patients were allocated to receive high-dosage CQ (ie, 600 mg CQ twice daily for 10 days) or low-dosage CQ (ie, 450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days).
Main Outcomes and Measures


Primary outcome was reduction in lethality by at least 50% in the high-dosage group compared with the low-dosage group. Data presented here refer primarily to safety and lethality outcomes during treatment on day 13. Secondary end points included participant clinical status, laboratory examinations, and electrocardiogram results. Outcomes will be presented to day 28. Viral respiratory secretion RNA detection was performed on days 0 and 4.
Results


Out of a predefined sample size of 440 patients, 81 were enrolled (41 [50.6%] to high-dosage group and 40 [49.4%] to low-dosage group). Enrolled patients had a mean (SD) age of 51.1 (13.9) years, and most (60 [75.3%]) were men. Older age (mean [SD] age, 54.7 [13.7] years vs 47.4 [13.3] years) and more heart disease (5 of 28 [17.9%] vs 0) were seen in the high-dose group. Viral RNA was detected in 31 of 40 (77.5%) and 31 of 41 (75.6%) patients in the low-dosage and high-dosage groups, respectively. Lethality until day 13 was 39.0% in the high-dosage group (16 of 41) and 15.0% in the low-dosage group (6 of 40). The high-dosage group presented more instance of QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds (7 of 37 [18.9%]) compared with the low-dosage group (4 of 36 [11.1%]). Respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only 6 of 27 patients (22.2%).
Conclusions and Relevance


The preliminary findings of this study suggest that the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir. These findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with nonsevere COVID-19.

45,32339262,A semiparametric Bayesian approach to population finding with time-to-event and toxicity data in a randomized clinical trial.,"A utility-based Bayesian population finding (BaPoFi) method was proposed by Morita and Müller to analyze data from a randomized clinical trial with the aim of identifying good predictive baseline covariates for optimizing the target population for a future study. The approach casts the population finding process as a formal decision problem together with a flexible probability model using a random forest to define a regression mean function. BaPoFi is constructed to handle a single continuous or binary outcome variable. In this paper, we develop BaPoFi-TTE as an extension of the earlier approach for clinically important cases of time-to-event (TTE) data with censoring, and also accounting for a toxicity outcome. We model the association of TTE data with baseline covariates using a semiparametric failure time model with a Pólya tree prior for an unknown error term and a random forest for a flexible regression mean function. We define a utility function that addresses a trade-off between efficacy and toxicity as one of the important clinical considerations for population finding. We examine the operating characteristics of the proposed method in extensive simulation studies. For illustration, we apply the proposed method to data from a randomized oncology clinical trial.

47,32339664,"Effect of prefrontal tDCS on resting brain fMRI graph measures in Alcohol Use Disorders: A randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study.","OBJECTIVES


Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a promising new adjuvant approach in the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) that has the potential to ameliorate the aberrations secondary to chronic alcohol use. In this study, using a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel-arm design, we examined the effects of prefrontal tDCS on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) and its correlates with impulsivity and time to first lapse in subjects with AUDs.
METHODS


Patients with AUD as per DSM-5 criteria were randomly allocated to receive a five-day course of either verum-tDCS (n = 12) or sham-tDCS (n = 12). Of them, 21 patients (verum/sham = 11/10) participated in both baseline and post-intervention 10-min rsfMRI sessions. Outside the scanner, subjects also performed the Stop-Signal Task at two time-points (baseline and post-intervention), which provided a measure of changes in impulsivity following tDCS. After completion of the post-intervention scan, all subjects were discharged and were followed-up for 90 days post-discharge or until lapse to first alcohol use.
RESULTS


Graph theoretical analysis of rsfMRI data revealed that verum-tDCS (but not sham) resulted in a significant increase in the global efficiency of brain networks with a concurrent significant reduction in global clustering; network-based statistical analysis identified a significant increase in the functional connectivity of a specific sub-network involving prefrontal regions. Furthermore, increased global efficiency of brain networks following verum tDCS predicted a significantly reduced likelihood of relapse. In addition, a reduction in the global clustering had a significant positive correlation with a reduction in the measure of impulsivity.
CONCLUSIONS


The present study adds further support to the increasing evidence base for the clinical utility of tDCS in AUDs. Importantly, we observed improvement in both whole-brain network efficiency as well as inter-regional connectivity within a specific local prefrontal sub-network that is relevant to the neurobiology of AUDs. Replication and extension of these promising leads from the present study can facilitate clinical translation of tDCS, given its advantages (i.e. safety, cost-effectiveness, administration ease with potential for remotely-supervised / home-based application) for treating patients with AUDs.",2020,"In addition, a reduction in the global clustering had a significant positive correlation with a reduction in the measure of impulsivity.

49,32339910,Supporting patients and carers affected by pancreatic cancer: A feasibility study of a counselling intervention.,"PURPOSE


Patients with pancreatic cancer have extremely high unmet psychological and physical needs. Family carers of these patients have even higher levels of distress than patients. Our purpose was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a counselling intervention in patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and their carers.
METHODS


We conducted a single-arm feasibility study of the PREPARES (Patients and RElatives affected by PAncreatic cancer: Referral, Education and Support) pilot intervention. Patient and carer participants received up to nine counselling sessions delivered by a trained nurse via telephone and/or telehealth technology. The intervention, informed by self-efficacy theory, involved components to assess and address care needs, and provide feedback to clinicians. Feasibility was measured using participation and retention rates. Participants completed semi-structured interviews at the end of the intervention about acceptability. These were analysed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS


Twelve people participated: five patients and seven carers (38% and 50% participation rates respectively). Most participants (eight) completed all nine counselling sessions; two chose to receive fewer sessions and two were discontinued requiring more intensive psychiatric support. The intervention was highly acceptable. Participants unanimously preferred the telephone over video-conferencing and to receive counselling separately from their carer/patient. The main perceived benefits were emotional support, the nurse-counsellors' knowledge, care coordination and personalised care. Suggested improvements included a welcome pack about their nurse-counsellor and that sessions should continue beyond nine sessions if required.

The effects of SIL on arterial pressure were evaluated using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Fifty patients diagnosed with primary arterial hypertension and erectile dysfunction (aged 57.4 ± 5.6 years), recruited in a tertiary public hospital, were treated with SIL (50 mg twice daily) or placebo (PLA) for two 30-day periods with a 30-day washout between them. Laser speckle contrast imaging coupled with acetylcholine skin iontophoresis was used to evaluate penile and systemic (forearm) cutaneous microvascular reactivity. SIL treatment increased penile basal microvascular flow (P = 0.002) and maximal endothelial-dependent peak response to skin iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh, P = 0.006). The area under the curve of microvascular vasodilation induced by ACh was also significantly increased (P = 0.02). Lastly, SIL treatment did not modify systemic microvascular reactivity. Twenty-four-hour ABPM (P = 0.0002) and daytime (P = 0.002) and nighttime (P = 0.001) mean diastolic blood pressure values were significantly reduced after SIL treatment. The scores of the Simplified International Index of Erectile Function (P < 0.0001) and the number of patients with positive responses to Sexual Encounter Profile question 3 (P < 0.0001) also increased after SIL treatment. Penile endothelium-dependent microvascular reactivity improved after continuous use of sildenafil in hypertensive patients with erectile dysfunction; the treatment also reduced blood pressure, suggesting that, in addition to improving erectile function, daily use of sildenafil could improve blood pressure control.",2020,"SIL treatment increased penile basal microvascular flow (P = 0.002) and maximal endothelial-dependent peak response to skin iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh, P = 0.006).","['hypertensive patients with erectile dysfunction', 'hypertensive patients presenting with erectile dysfunction', 'Fifty patients diagnosed with primary arterial hypertension and erectile dysfunction (aged 57.4\u2009±\u20095.6 years), recruited in a tertiary public hospital']","['SIL', 'Laser speckle contrast imaging coupled with acetylcholine skin iontophoresis', 'sildenafil', 'chronic type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibition', 'sildenafil citrate (SIL, 1-month 50\u2009mg twice daily', 'placebo (PLA', 'placebo']","['penile and systemic endothelial microvascular function', 'penile microvascular reactivity', 'ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM', 'blood pressure control', 'systemic microvascular reactivity', 'area under the curve of microvascular vasodilation', 'daytime', 'mean diastolic blood pressure values', 'microvascular reactivity', 'scores of the Simplified International Index of Erectile Function', 'penile basal microvascular flow', 'penile and systemic (forearm) cutaneous microvascular reactivity', 'arterial pressure']","[{'cui': 'C0857121', 'cui_str': 'Hypertensive'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0242350', 'cui_str': 'Impotence'}, {'cui': 'C0150312', 'cui_str': 'Present'}, {'cui': 'C0011900', 'cui_str': 'Diagnosis'}, {'cui': 'C0205225', 'cui_str': 'Principal'}, {'cui': 'C0020538', 'cui_str': 'Hypertensive disorder'}, {'cui': 'C4517794', 'cui_str': '5.6'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0205372', 'cui_str': 'Tertiary'}, {'cui': 'C0020022', 'cui_str': 'Public Hospitals'}]","[{'cui': 'C0257766', 'cui_str': 'SILV protein, human'}, {'cui': 'C3854375', 'cui_str': 'Laser speckle contrast imaging'}, {'cui': 'C0010222', 'cui_str': 'Couples'}, {'cui': 'C0001041', 'cui_str': 'Acetylcholine'}, {'cui': 'C0444099', 'cui_str': 'Specimen from skin'}, {'cui': 'C0022024', 'cui_str': 'Iontophoresis procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0529793', 'cui_str': 'sildenafil'}, {'cui': 'C0205191', 'cui_str': 'Chronic'}, {'cui': 'C0457499', 'cui_str': 'Type 5'}, {'cui': 'C0031640', 'cui_str': 'Phosphoric diester hydrolase'}, {'cui': 'C0021467', 'cui_str': 'Psychological Inhibition'}, {'cui': 'C0724693', 'cui_str': 'Sildenafil citrate'}, {'cui': 'C0332177', 'cui_str': 'Monthly'}, {'cui': 'C0585361', 'cui_str': 'Twice a day'}, {'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}]","[{'cui': 'C0030851', 'cui_str': 'Penile structure'}, {'cui': 'C0205373', 'cui_str': 'Systemic'}, {'cui': 'C0014257', 'cui_str': 'Structure of endothelium tissue'}, {'cui': 'C0443258', 'cui_str': 'Microvascular'}, {'cui': 'C0031843', 'cui_str': 'PH'}, {'cui': 'C0443286', 'cui_str': 'Reaction'}, {'cui': 'C0242876', 'cui_str': 'Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring'}, {'cui': 'C0005823', 'cui_str': 'Blood pressure'}, {'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}, {'cui': 'C0376690', 'cui_str': 'Area under the curve'}, {'cui': 'C0042401', 'cui_str': 'Vasodilatation'}, {'cui': 'C0332169', 'cui_str': 'Daytime'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0428883', 'cui_str': 'Diastolic blood pressure'}, {'cui': 'C1273875', 'cui_str': 'Values (community)'}, {'cui': 'C0449820', 'cui_str': 'Score'}, {'cui': 'C2960541', 'cui_str': 'International index of erectile function'}, {'cui': 'C0205112', 'cui_str': 'Basal'}, {'cui': 'C1522447', 'cui_str': 'Cutaneous route'}, {'cui': 'C0232108', 'cui_str': 'Arterial pulse pressure'}]",50.0,0.0960623,"SIL treatment increased penile basal microvascular flow (P = 0.002) and maximal endothelial-dependent peak response to skin iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh, P = 0.006).","[{'ForeName': 'Valéria', 'Initials': 'V', 'LastName': 'Verri', 'Affiliation': 'National Institute of Cardiology, Ministry of Health, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.'}, {'ForeName': 'Alessandro R', 'Initials': 'AR', 'LastName': 'Nascimento', 'Affiliation': 'National Institute of Cardiology, Ministry of Health, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.'}, {'ForeName': 'Andrea A', 'Initials': 'AA', 'LastName': 'Brandao', 'Affiliation': 'State University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.'}, {'ForeName': 'Eduardo', 'Initials': 'E', 'LastName': 'Tibirica', 'Affiliation': 'National Institute of Cardiology, Ministry of Health, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. etibi@uol.com.br.'}]",Journal of human hypertension,['10.1038/s41371-020-0343-3']

However, data from comparative analysis of these surgery types are insufficient. Objective:  Prospective randomized trial for comparison of open and endoscopic surgery outcome in pediatric chronic rhinosinusitis. Material and methods:  The cohort included 30 pediatric patients (7-17 years) with open frontal sinus surgery and 34 patients who underwent FESS using DrafIIa. Lund-Kennedy and Lund-Mackay scores, as well as Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-20 (SNOT-20)questionnaire was used for pre- and postoperative assessment. Results:  Open surgery and FESS resulted in a significant improvement in total Lund-Kennedy, Lund-Mackay, and SNOT-20 scores, being more profound in FESS group. Using FESS significantly reduced surgery duration by 15% as compared to open surgery. In addition, open surgery was associated with a higher rate of scar formation, reduced local sensitivity, as well as local soreness, lacrimation, and psychological discomfort. In regression models FESS was negatively associated with postoperative total Lund-Kennedy, Lund-Mackay, and SNOT-20 scores.

53,32340524,Positive Health Beliefs and Blood Pressure Reduction in the DESERVE Study.,"Background There is growing recognition that positive health beliefs may promote blood pressure (BP) reduction, which is critical to stroke prevention but remains a persistent challenge. Yet, studies that examine the association between positive health beliefs and BP among stroke survivors are lacking. Methods and Results Data came from the DESERVE (Discharge Educational Strategies for Reduction of Vascular Events) study, a randomized controlled trial of a skills-based behavioral intervention to reduce vascular risk in a multiethnic cohort of 552 transient ischemic attack and mild/moderate stroke patients in New York City. The exposure was perception that people can protect themselves from having a stroke (ie, prevention self-efficacy) at baseline. The association between systolic BP (SBP) reduction at 12-month follow-up and self-efficacy was examined using linear regression adjusted for key confounders, overall and stratified by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and intervention trial arm. Approximately three quarters endorsed self-efficacy. These participants had, on average, 5.6 mm Hg greater SBP reduction compared with those who did not endorse it (95% CI, 0.5-10.7 mm Hg;  P =0.032). Self-efficacy was significantly associated with greater SBP reduction, particularly among female versus male, younger versus older, and Hispanic versus non-Hispanic white patients. Sensitivity analysis adjusting for baseline SBP instead of elevated BP yielded no association between self-efficacy and SBP reduction, but showed sex differences in this association (women: β=5.3; 95% CI, -0.2 to 10.8;  P =0.057; men: β=-3.3; 95% CI, -9.4 to 2.9;  P =0.300; interaction  P =0.064). Conclusions Self-efficacy was linked with greater SBP reduction among female stroke survivors. Targeted strategies to improve health beliefs after stroke may be important for risk factor management.

54,32340530,Cardiovascular Risk and Resilience Among Black Adults: Rationale and Design of the MECA Study.,"Background Cardiovascular disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity, and mortality have declined in the past several decades; however, disparities persist among subsets of the population. Notably, blacks have not experienced the same improvements on the whole as whites. Furthermore, frequent reports of relatively poorer health statistics among the black population have led to a broad assumption that black race reliably predicts relatively poorer health outcomes. However, substantial intraethnic and intraracial heterogeneity exists; moreover, individuals with similar risk factors and environmental exposures are often known to experience vastly different cardiovascular health outcomes. Thus, some individuals have good outcomes even in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors, a concept known as resilience. Methods and Results The MECA (Morehouse-Emory Center for Health Equity) Study was designed to investigate the multilevel exposures that contribute to ""resilience"" in the face of risk for poor cardiovascular health among blacks in the greater Atlanta, GA, metropolitan area. We used census tract data to determine ""at-risk"" and ""resilient"" neighborhoods with high or low prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, based on cardiovascular death, hospitalization, and emergency department visits for blacks. More than 1400 individuals from these census tracts assented to demographic, health, and psychosocial questionnaires administered through telephone surveys. Afterwards, ≈500 individuals were recruited to enroll in a clinical study, where risk biomarkers, such as oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers, endothelial progenitor cells, metabolomic and microRNA profiles, and subclinical vascular dysfunction were measured. In addition, comprehensive behavioral questionnaires were collected and ideal cardiovascular health metrics were assessed using the American Heart Association's Life Simple 7 measure. Last, 150 individuals with low Life Simple 7 were recruited and randomized to a behavioral mobile health (eHealth) plus health coach or eHealth only intervention and followed up for improvement. Conclusions The MECA Study is investigating socioenvironmental and individual behavioral measures that promote resilience to cardiovascular disease in blacks by assessing biological, functional, and molecular mechanisms.

The second objective was to assess the effects of these interventions on cervical motor activity (ranges of motion and muscle endurance), attention, and the ability to generate motor images. Study design:  Single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Materials and methods:  Fifty-four healthy subjects were randomly assigned to each group. Response conditioned pain modulation, pressure pain threshold, were the main variables. The secondary outcome measures included, cervical range of motion, Neck flexor endurance test, mental movement representation associated and psychosocial variables. Results:  All groups showed significant differences in time factor for all evaluated variables ( p  < .01) except pressure pain threshold over the tibial region. The  post hoc  analysis revealed significant within-group differences in the AE and AO groups in conditioned pain modulation ( p  < .05), with medium effect size in time [AE ( d  -0.61); AO ( d  -0.74)]. Conclusion:  The results showed that within-group changes in conditioned pain modulation, cervical muscle endurance, and attention where founded only in the AE and AO groups. Variations in pain thresholds at pressure in the trapezium area were also obtained in the three groups.

56,32340846,3-Dimensional printing templates guiding versus free hand technique for cervical lateral mass screw fixation: A prospective study.,"OBJECTIVE


In this randomized, single blind and controlled study, the feasibility and precision of 3-dimensional printing templates for cervical lateral mass screw insertion was evaluated.
METHODS


A total of 6 patients (72 screws), who were diagnosed with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and developmental cervical spinal stenosis, were randomly divided into A and B two groups. All subjects underwent modified posterior surgery with using cervical lateral mass screws insertion (C4-C6). Group A underwent surgeries with screw insertion assisted by the guidance of 3-dimensional printing templates and Group B underwent surgeries with screw insertion by freehand. The criteria of the accuracy of screw placement were set as the main evaluation indicators.
RESULTS


There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in age, improvement rate of JOA, operation time and blood loss. According to Bayard's criteria, 32 screws (88.9%) were described as ""acceptable"" in group A and 22 screws (61.1%) were described as ""acceptable"" in Group B (P < 0.05). Based on our criteria, the ""excellent and good"" rate of screws was 83.3% in group A and 47.2% in Group B, respectively (P < 0.05). The precision of screws' location in Group A was superior to that in Group B.

57,32340869,Effectiveness of a chest physiotherapy care map in hospitalized patients.,"BACKGROUND


Conventional chest physiotherapy (chest PT) has been widely used to facilitate airway clearance. However, conventional chest PT is time consuming, unnecessary prescriptions result in heavier workloads for therapists. Therefore, judicious prescription of chest PT is important.
PURPOSE


To develop a chest physiotherapy care-map and evaluate its efficacy.
METHOD


Seventy-eight hospitalized patients who were consulted for chest PT were enrolled and consecutively allocated into two groups of 39 patients. Group I and II was enrolled before and after the implementation of the chest PT map, respectively.
RESULT


After the care-map was implemented, the chest PT prescription rate decreased from 56.4% to 33.3%, (p = 0.040). The duration of conventional chest PT trended to lower but not reaching significance from 4.5 (1-28) to 4 (2-9) days, (p = 0.582). The mean cost of chest PT was reduced by 38.2% (p = 0.019).
CONCLUSION


Chest PT care-map is an effective tool to reduce unnecessary chest PT prescriptions, lower costs, and more effectively allocate therapist time.",2020,"The mean cost of chest PT was reduced by 38.2% (p = 0.019).

58,32340871,Effect of aspirin dose on hemocompatibility-related outcomes with a magnetically levitated left ventricular assist device: An analysis from the MOMENTUM 3 study.,"BACKGROUND


Aspirin (ASA) anti-platelet therapy is mandated with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) to prevent hemocompatibility-related adverse events (HRAEs). However, the optimal dose of ASA with HeartMate 3 (HM3) LVAD is unknown.
METHODS


In an exploratory analysis of HM3-supported patients in the MOMENTUM 3 study (NCT02224755), 2 groups were analyzed: usual-dose (325 mg) and low-dose (81 mg) ASA with anti-coagulation targeted to an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0. Exclusion criteria included patients not receiving either ASA 81 mg or 325 mg, those with HRAEs ≤7 days after device implantation, and those receiving >1 anti-platelet agent. The primary end-point was survival free from HRAEs (non-surgical bleeding, pump thrombosis, stroke, and peripheral arterial thromboembolic events) at 2 years.
RESULTS


Overall, 321 HM3 patients (usual-dose: n = 141, low-dose: n = 180) were included in this analysis. Usual-dose group patients were younger (57 ± 13 vs 60 ± 12 years, p = 0.035) and less often assigned destination therapy (55% vs 67%, p = 0.029) than low-dose ASA. At 2 years, a similar proportion of patients in the usual- and low-dose groups (43.4% vs 45.3%, p = 0.94) met the primary end-point. There were no differences in survival free from hemorrhagic (usual-dose: 54.4% vs low-dose: 51.7%, p = 0.42) or thrombotic (usual-dose: 76.8% vs low-dose: 75.7%, p = 0.92) events.

59,32340878,Pre-operative Patient Specific Flow Predictions to Improve Haemodialysis Arteriovenous Fistula Maturation (Shunt Simulation Study): A Randomised Controlled Trial.,"OBJECTIVE


An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) needs to mature before it becomes suitable to cannulate for haemodialysis treatment. Maturation importantly depends on the post-operative flow increase. Unfortunately, 20-40% of AVFs fail to mature (FTM). A patient specific computational model that predicts immediate post-operative flow was developed, and it was hypothesised that providing information from this model for planning of fistula creation might reduce FTM rates.
METHODS


A multicentre, randomised controlled trial in nine Dutch hospitals was conducted in which patients with renal failure who were referred for AVF creation, were recruited. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to the control or computer simulation group. Both groups underwent a work up, with physical and duplex ultrasonography (DUS) examination. In the simulation group the data from the DUS examination were used for model simulations, and based on the immediate post-operative flow prediction, the ideal AVF configuration was recommended. The primary endpoint was AVF maturation defined as an AVF flow ≥500 mL/min and a vein inner diameter of ≥4 mm six weeks post-operatively. The secondary endpoint was model performance (i.e. comparisons between measured and predicted flows, and (multivariable) regression analysis for maturation probability with accompanying area under the receiver operator characteristic curve [AUC]).
RESULTS


A total of 236 patients were randomly assigned (116 in the control and 120 in the simulation group), of whom 205 (100 and 105 respectively) were analysed for the primary endpoint. There was no difference in FTM rates between the groups (29% and 32% respectively). Immediate post-operative flow prediction had an OR of 1.15 (1.06-1.26; p < .001) per 100 mL/min for maturation, and the accompanying AUC was 0.67 (0.59-0.75).
CONCLUSION


Providing pre-operative patient specific flow simulations during surgical planning does not result in improved maturation rates. Further study is needed to improve the predictive power of these simulations in order to render the computational model an adjunct to surgical planning.",2020,"Immediate post-operative flow prediction had an OR of 1.15 (1.06-1.26; p < .001) per 100 mL/min for maturation, and the accompanying AUC was 0.67 (0.59-0.75).

60,32340927,Memantine Effects on Electroencephalographic Measures of Putative Excitatory/Inhibitory Balance in Schizophrenia.,"BACKGROUND


Abnormalities in cortical excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance are thought to underlie sensory and information processing deficits in schizophrenia. Deficits in early auditory information processing mediate both neurocognitive and functional impairment and appear to be normalized by acute pharmacologic challenge with the NMDA antagonist memantine (MEM).
METHODS


Thirty-six subjects with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and 31 healthy control subjects underwent electroencephalographic recordings. Subjects ingested either placebo or MEM (10 or 20 mg) in a double-blind, within-subject, crossover, randomized design. The aperiodic, 1/f-like scaling property of the neural power spectra, which is thought to index relative E/I balance, was estimated using a robust linear regression algorithm.
RESULTS


Patients with schizophrenia had greater aperiodic components compared with healthy control subjects (p < .01, d = 0.64), which was normalized after 20 mg MEM. Analysis revealed a significant dose × diagnosis interaction (p < .0001, d = 0.82). Furthermore, the MEM effect (change in aperiodic component in MEM vs. placebo conditions) was associated with baseline attention and vigilance (r = .54, p < .05) and MEM-induced enhancements in gamma power (r = -.60, p < .01).
CONCLUSIONS


Findings confirmed E/I balance abnormalities in schizophrenia that were normalized with acute MEM administration and suggest that neurocognitive profiles may predict treatment response based on E/I sensitivity. These data provide proof-of-concept evidence for the utility of E/I balance indices as metrics of acute pharmacologic sensitivity for central nervous system therapeutics.",2020,"RESULTS

61,32341044,(Cost-)effectiveness of lower extremity nerve decompression surgery in subjects with diabetes: the DeCompression (DECO) trial-study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,"INTRODUCTION


The peripheral nerves of patients with diabetes are often pathologically swollen, which results in entrapment at places of anatomical narrowing. This results in nerve dysfunction. Surgical treatment of compression neuropathies in the lower extremities (lower extremity nerve decompression (LEND)) results in relief of symptoms and gain in peripheral nerve function, which may lead to less sensory loss (short term) and less associated detrimental effects including foot ulceration and amputations, and lower costs (long term). The aim of the DeCompression trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and (cost-)effectiveness of surgical decompression of compressed lower extremity nerves (LEND surgery) compared with patients treated with conventional (non-surgical) care.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS


A stratified randomised (1 to 1) controlled trial comparing LEND surgery (intervention) with conventional non-surgical care (control strategy) in subjects with diabetes with problems of neuropathy due to compression neuropathies in the lower extremity. Randomisation is stratified for participating hospital (n=11) and gender. Patients and controls have the same follow-up at 1.5, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 and 48 months. Participants (n=344) will be recruited in 12 months and enrolled in all affiliated hospitals in which they receive both the intervention or conventional non-surgical care and follow-up. Outcome assessors are blinded to group assignment.
PRIMARY OUTCOME


disease-specific quality of life (Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire-Diabetic Neuropathy).
SECONDARY OUTCOMES


health-related quality of life (EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D5L), 36-item Short Form (SF-36)), plantar sensation (Rotterdam Diabetic Foot Test Battery), incidence of ulcerations/amputations, resource use and productivity loss (Medical Cost Questionnaire, Productivity Cost Questionnaire) during follow-up. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be estimated on the basis of the collected empirical data and a cost-utility model.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION


Ethics approval has been granted by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of Utrecht University Medical Center (reference: NL68312.041.19v5, protocol number: 19-335/M). Dissemination of results will be via journal articles and presentations at national and international conferences.

62,32341047,Text messages for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: the TextMe2 randomised controlled trial protocol.,"INTRODUCTION


Mobile health may be an effective means of delivering customised individually directed health promotion interventions for cardiovascular disease (CVD) primary prevention. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a lifestyle-focused text messaging programme for primary CVD prevention.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS


Single-blind randomised controlled trial with 6 months' follow-up in 246 patients with moderate-high absolute cardiovascular risk and without coronary heart disease recruited from a rapid access cardiology clinic. Participants will be randomised to receive either usual care or TextMe2 (text message-based prevention programme). The TextMe2 programme provides support, motivation and education on five topics: diet, physical activity, smoking, general cardiovascular health and medication adherence, and is delivered in four text messages per week over 6 months. The primary outcome is change in the proportion of patients who have three or more of five key modifiable risk factors that are uncontrolled (low-density lipoprotein >2.0 mmol/L, systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg, body mass index >24.9 kg/m 2 , physical activity (less than the equivalent of 150 min of moderate intensity each week), current smoker). Secondary outcomes are changes in single biomedical risk factors, behavioural risk factors, quality of life, depression/anxiety scores, medication adherence, cardiovascular health literacy and hospital readmissions/representations. Analysis will be according to the intention-to-treat principle and full statistical analysis plan developed prior to data lock.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION


This study has been approved by the Western Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee at Westmead (AU/RED/HREC/17/WMEAD/186). Results will be presented at scientific meetings and published in peer-reviewed publications.

63,32390164,"Thiamidol containing treatment regimens in facial hyperpigmentation: An international multi-center approach consisting of a double-blind, controlled, split-face study and of an open label, real-world study.","OBJECTIVE


Tyrosinase is the rate-limiting enzyme in melanogenesis. Thiamidol is the most potent inhibitor of human tyrosinase out of 50,000 tested compounds. In clinical studies, it was shown to improve facial hyperpigmentation, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and age spots significantly. To identify the optimal number of daily Thiamidol applications, we conducted a split-face study comparing the efficacy and tolerability of four-times with two-times daily application. Subsequently, we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of a typical face care regimen containing Thiamidol in a real-world study.
METHODS


The split-face study was double-blind, randomized, controlled, including two Thiamidol containing products (serum and day care SPF 30). The serum was applied twice-daily on one half of the face, and the day care SPF30 twice-daily on the whole face. The real-world study was open-label, observational, including three Thiamidol containing products (day care SPF 30 in the morning, serum and night care in the evening). In both studies, subjects with mild-to-moderate facial hyperpigmentation applied the products over 12 weeks. Assessments included clinical and subjective grading of hyperpigmentation, skin condition, hemi-/modified MASI, chromameter, and clinical photography.
RESULTS


In the split-face study (n=34), hyperpigmentation, skin roughness, and hMASI improved all significantly (p<0.001) versus baseline, with first visible results after two weeks of twice-daily application. The four-times daily application led to significant improvement versus the two-times daily application. In the real-world study (n=83), all evaluated parameters, including skin condition and chromametry (n=30), improved significantly (p<0.001) in comparison to baseline and the corresponding preceding visits. The subjects judged the cosmetic properties of the products positively. In both studies the products were well tolerated.
CONCLUSION


Four-times daily Thiamidol improves facial hyperpigmentation significantly more than two-times daily application and is well tolerated by the subjects. The real-world study with a typical face care regimen containing Thiamidol shows improvement of facial hyperpigmentation and confirms tolerability. Furthermore, the data provide evidence for the suitability of this three-product Thiamidol regimen for day-to-day life.",2020,"In clinical studies, it was shown to improve facial hyperpigmentation, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and age spots significantly.","['subjects with mild-to-moderate facial hyperpigmentation', 'facial hyperpigmentation']",['Thiamidol'],"['tolerated', 'facial hyperpigmentation', 'facial hyperpigmentation, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation', 'efficacy and tolerability', 'facial hyperpigmentation and confirms tolerability', 'clinical and subjective grading of hyperpigmentation, skin condition, hemi-/modified MASI, chromameter, and clinical photography', 'hyperpigmentation, skin roughness, and hMASI']","[{'cui': 'C1299392', 'cui_str': 'Mild to moderate'}, {'cui': 'C0015450', 'cui_str': 'Face structure'}, {'cui': 'C0162834', 'cui_str': 'Hyperpigmentation'}]",[],"[{'cui': 'C0015450', 'cui_str': 'Face structure'}, {'cui': 'C0162834', 'cui_str': 'Hyperpigmentation'}, {'cui': 'C0333616', 'cui_str': 'Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation'}, {'cui': 'C1280519', 'cui_str': 'Effectiveness'}, {'cui': 'C0521093', 'cui_str': 'Confirmed by'}, {'cui': 'C0205210', 'cui_str': 'Clinical'}, {'cui': 'C0439655', 'cui_str': 'Subjective'}, {'cui': 'C0037274', 'cui_str': 'Disorder of skin'}, {'cui': 'C1285521', 'cui_str': 'Hemi'}, {'cui': 'C0431056', 'cui_str': 'Photography of patient'}, {'cui': 'C0859038', 'cui_str': 'Skin roughness'}]",50000.0,0.0212795,"In clinical studies, it was shown to improve facial hyperpigmentation, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and age spots significantly.","[{'ForeName': 'W G', 'Initials': 'WG', 'LastName': 'Philipp-Dormston', 'Affiliation': 'Hautzentrum Köln, Schillingsrotter Str. 39-41, 50996, Köln, Germany.'}, {'ForeName': 'A', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Vila Echagüe', 'Affiliation': 'Centro de referencia en tratamiento laser, Av.

64,32341641,The Effect of Baseline Rescue Medication Use on Efficacy and Safety of Nebulized Glycopyrrolate Treatment in Patients with COPD from the GOLDEN 3 and 4 Studies.,"Purpose


Rescue medication use is common in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and tends to increase with symptoms and disease severity. An analysis of baseline rescue medication use was conducted to inform on patient phenotypes and subsequent effects on lung function, symptoms, and safety following 12 weeks of nebulized glycopyrrolate (GLY) 25 µg twice daily or placebo in patients with moderate-to-very-severe COPD.
Patients and Methods


Pooled data from the 12-week, placebo-controlled GOLDEN 3 and 4 studies (n=781) were used to assign patients into quarters based on baseline rescue medication use (ie, average puffs-per-day) during the run-in period. Placebo-adjusted trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ), St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score and EXAcerbations of COPD Tool-Respiratory Symptoms (EXACT-RS) total score data were reported; safety was evaluated by reviewing the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs).
Results


Baseline rescue medication use was a proxy for disease severity, evidenced by decreased lung function, increased health status scores, symptom scores and use of background long-acting β2-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids across quarters and treatment groups. Treatment with GLY led to greater improvements from baseline in trough FEV 1 , SGRQ and EXACT-RS scores compared with placebo in all rescue medication use quarters. Additionally, the SGRQ and EXACT-RS exhibited greater improvement with increased baseline rescue medication use with GLY treatment. In the Q4 patients, SGRQ (≥4-unit reduction) or EXACT-RS (≥2-unit reduction) responders were significantly greater with GLY compared with placebo. AE and SAE incidences were similar across quartiles.
Conclusion


These results suggest that baseline rescue medication use assessments may be useful in the management of COPD. Treatment with nebulized GLY improved lung function and symptom scores, regardless of baseline rescue medication use. These results support the use of nebulized GLY for the treatment of COPD, independent of baseline rescue medication use.",2020,"Treatment with GLY led to greater improvements from baseline in trough FEV 1 , SGRQ and EXACT-RS scores compared with placebo in all rescue medication use quarters.","['chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\xa0(COPD) patients', 'Patients with COPD from the GOLDEN 3 and 4 Studies', 'patients with moderate-to-very-severe COPD']","['nebulized GLY', 'Placebo', 'nebulized glycopyrrolate (GLY', 'Nebulized Glycopyrrolate', 'placebo']","['Efficacy and Safety', ""trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ), St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score and EXAcerbations of COPD Tool-Respiratory Symptoms (EXACT-RS"", 'AE and SAE incidences', 'trough FEV 1 , SGRQ and EXACT-RS scores', 'lung function and symptom scores', 'lung function, increased health status scores, symptom scores and use of background long-acting β2-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids', 'incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs']","[{'cui': 'C0024117', 'cui_str': 'Chronic obstructive lung disease'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0008972', 'cui_str': 'Clinical Study'}, {'cui': 'C0205081', 'cui_str': 'Moderate'}, {'cui': 'C3641272', 'cui_str': 'Very severe'}]","[{'cui': 'C0017970', 'cui_str': 'Glycopyrrolate'}, {'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}]","[{'cui': 'C1280519', 'cui_str': 'Effectiveness'}, {'cui': 'C0036043', 'cui_str': 'Safety'}, {'cui': 'C0444506', 'cui_str': 'Trough'}, {'cui': 'C0849974', 'cui_str': 'FEV 1'}, {'cui': 'C0034394', 'cui_str': 'Questionnaires'}, {'cui': 'C0439810', 'cui_str': 'Total'}, {'cui': 'C0449820', 'cui_str': 'Score'}, {'cui': 'C0024117', 'cui_str': 'Chronic obstructive lung disease'}, {'cui': 'C0336791', 'cui_str': 'Tool'}, {'cui': 'C0037090', 'cui_str': 'Respiratory symptom'}, {'cui': 'C0021149', 'cui_str': 'Incidence'}, {'cui': 'C0024119', 'cui_str': 'Pulmonary function test'}, {'cui': 'C0683368', 'cui_str': 'symptoms'}, {'cui': 'C0205217', 'cui_str': 'Increased'}, {'cui': 'C0018759', 'cui_str': 'Health status'}, {'cui': 'C1524063', 'cui_str': 'Use of'}, {'cui': 'C0205166', 'cui_str': 'Long'}, {'cui': 'C0079613', 'cui_str': 'Adoptive Immunotherapy'}, {'cui': 'C0243192', 'cui_str': 'agonists'}, {'cui': 'C0004048', 'cui_str': 'Inhaling'}, {'cui': 'C0001617', 'cui_str': 'Adrenal cortex hormone'}, {'cui': 'C0877248', 'cui_str': 'Adverse event'}]",781.0,0.110616,"Treatment with GLY led to greater improvements from baseline in trough FEV 1 , SGRQ and EXACT-RS scores compared with placebo in all rescue medication use quarters.","[{'ForeName': 'James F', 'Initials': 'JF', 'LastName': 'Donohue', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pulmonary Diseases and Critical Care Medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Ayca', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Ozol-Godfrey', 'Affiliation': 'Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Thomas', 'Initials': 'T', 'LastName': 'Goodin', 'Affiliation': 'Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Shahin', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Sanjar', 'Affiliation': 'Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA.'}]",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,['10.2147/COPD.S242767']
65,32341646,Pretreatment with Nalbuphine Prevents Sufentanil-Induced Cough During the Anesthesia Induction: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Background


Sufentanil-induced cough is frequent during the induction of anesthesia. The aim of this research was to assess the influence of pretreatment with nalbuphine on sufentanil-induced cough.
Patients and Methods


A total of 210 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I-II patients who are 18-70 years old and scheduled for elective surgery were randomly divided into two groups. Group N was pretreated with 0.3 mg/kg nalbuphine at 150 s before induction with sufentanil, and Group C received the same volume of normal saline as the placebo. We assessed the incidence and severity of cough 2 minutes after sufentanil administration. We also recorded the hemodynamic changes and side effects of sufentanil after sufentanil administration.
Results


No patients had cough in group N, and 30 patients had cough in group C (degree of cough: mild 8; moderate 10; severe 12). The incidence and severity of cough in group N were significantly lower than those in group C.

66,32341649,Effectiveness of a Multifaceted Educational Intervention to Enhance Therapeutic Regimen Adherence and Quality of Life Amongst Iranian Hemodialysis Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial (MEITRA Study).,"Purpose


A multimodal intervention designed and executed to improve therapeutic regimen adherence and quality of life in a sample of Iranian hemodialysis patients. Its feasibility and impact was assessed post intervention.
Patients and Methods


This randomized controlled trial (RCT) study was conducted at two hemodialysis wards of the Shahrvand hospital located in Sari, the capital city of the Mazandaran province, north of Iran. The study sample included patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving outpatient hemodialysis treatment. Considering 10% attrition, 70 registered patients were randomly categorized into intervention and control groups. The proposed intervention included playing of relevant educational video tracks, conducting eight cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) group sessions, and telephone-based peer support. Data were collected applying a set of questionnaires including sociodemographic, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-SF), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Patient Satisfaction with Nursing Care Quality Questionnaire (PSNCQQ), End-Stage Renal Disease Adherence Questionnaire (ESRD-AQ) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-SF) scale. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected at baseline in both groups and the postintervention assessment was performed in the intervention and nonintervention groups after one month and three months.
Results


A significant change in the self-reported depression symptoms ( P =0.001), mean social support score ( P =0.001), nursing care satisfaction score ( P =0.001), quality of life score ( P =0.001) and interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) ( P =0.001) was observed among the participants in the intervention group compared to the baseline measures. The highest rise in the ESRD-AQ scores within the intervention group was observed after one month of intervention (mean difference=131.88) compared to the baseline values. Same pattern of statistically significant changes in mean scores of the intervention group's attendants in all subscales of the ESRD-AQ were also ascertained.
Conclusion


This interventional study revealed that inaugurating of a feasible low-cost intervention without need to add major logistic or financial inputs into existing health-care systems, especially in resource limited contexts, is achievable. Findings of this study could provide insights into scientific basis of evidence-informed interventions applicable in the realm of health-care delivery.",2020,"A significant change in the self-reported depression symptoms ( P =0.001), mean social support score ( P =0.001), nursing care satisfaction score ( P =0.001), quality of life score ( P =0.001) and interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) ( P =0.001) was observed among the participants in the intervention group compared to the baseline measures.","['Iranian Hemodialysis Patients', 'Iranian hemodialysis patients', 'patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving outpatient hemodialysis treatment', 'two hemodialysis wards of the Shahrvand hospital located in Sari, the capital city of the Mazandaran province, north of Iran']","['cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) group sessions, and telephone-based peer support', 'Multifaceted Educational Intervention']","['mean scores', 'quality of life score', 'therapeutic regimen adherence and quality of life', 'Therapeutic Regimen Adherence and Quality of Life', 'sociodemographic, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-SF), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Patient Satisfaction with Nursing Care Quality Questionnaire (PSNCQQ), End-Stage Renal Disease Adherence Questionnaire (ESRD-AQ) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-SF) scale', 'nursing care satisfaction score', 'mean social support score', 'interdialytic weight gain (IDWG', 'self-reported depression symptoms', 'ESRD-AQ scores']","[{'cui': 'C0019004', 'cui_str': 'Hemodialysis'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0022661', 'cui_str': 'Chronic renal failure'}, {'cui': 'C0029921', 'cui_str': 'Outpatient'}, {'cui': 'C0039798', 'cui_str': 'therapy'}, {'cui': 'C1305702', 'cui_str': 'Ward'}, {'cui': 'C0019994', 'cui_str': 'Hospitals'}, {'cui': 'C0332285', 'cui_str': 'In'}, {'cui': 'C0443055', 'cui_str': 'Sari - microbial strain'}, {'cui': 'C0006909', 'cui_str': 'Capital'}, {'cui': 'C0008848', 'cui_str': 'Cities'}, {'cui': 'C0022065', 'cui_str': 'Iran'}]","[{'cui': 'C0009244', 'cui_str': 'Cognitive therapy'}, {'cui': 'C0439745', 'cui_str': 'Grouped'}, {'cui': 'C0039457', 'cui_str': 'Telephone'}, {'cui': 'C0002055', 'cui_str': 'Alkali'}, {'cui': 'C0183683', 'cui_str': 'Support'}, {'cui': 'C0184661', 'cui_str': 'Procedure'}]","[{'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0449820', 'cui_str': 'Score'}, {'cui': 'C0518214', 'cui_str': 'Quality of life satisfaction'}, {'cui': 'C0087111', 'cui_str': 'Therapeutic procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0040808', 'cui_str': 'Protocols, Treatment'}, {'cui': 'C2364055', 'cui_str': 'Compliant behavior'}, {'cui': 'C0451022', 'cui_str': 'Beck depression inventory'}, {'cui': 'C0006448', 'cui_str': 'Burundi'}, {'cui': 'C0175659', 'cui_str': 'Scale'}, {'cui': 'C0030971', 'cui_str': 'Perception'}, {'cui': 'C0037438', 'cui_str': 'Social support'}, {'cui': 'C0030702', 'cui_str': 'Client satisfaction'}, {'cui': 'C0028678', 'cui_str': 'nursing'}, {'cui': 'C0332306', 'cui_str': 'Quality'}, {'cui': 'C0034394', 'cui_str': 'Questionnaires'}, {'cui': 'C0022661', 'cui_str': 'Chronic renal failure'}, {'cui': 'C0043237', 'cui_str': 'Organization, World Health'}, {'cui': 'C0242428', 'cui_str': 'Satisfaction'}, {'cui': 'C0043094', 'cui_str': 'Weight gain'}, {'cui': 'C2700446', 'cui_str': 'Self-reported'}, {'cui': 'C0086132', 'cui_str': 'Symptoms of depression'}]",70.0,0.02827,"A significant change in the self-reported depression symptoms ( P =0.001), mean social support score ( P =0.001), nursing care satisfaction score ( P =0.001), quality of life score ( P =0.001) and interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) ( P =0.001) was observed among the participants in the intervention group compared to the baseline measures.","[{'ForeName': 'Leila', 'Initials': 'L', 'LastName': 'Zhianfar', 'Affiliation': 'Health Education & Promotion Department, Faculty of Health, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.'}, {'ForeName': 'Haidar', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Nadrian', 'Affiliation': 'Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.'}, {'ForeName': 'Mohammad', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Asghari Jafarabadi', 'Affiliation': 'Epidemiology and Biostatistics Department, Faculty of Health, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.'}, {'ForeName': 'Fatemeh', 'Initials': 'F', 'LastName': 'Espahbodi', 'Affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.'}, {'ForeName': 'Abdolreza', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Shaghaghi', 'Affiliation': 'Health Education & Promotion Department, Faculty of Health, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.'}]",Journal of multidisciplinary healthcare,['10.2147/JMDH.S247128']
67,32341662,Safety and Efficacy of Oral Melatonin When Combined with Thoracic Epidural Analgesia in Patients with Bilateral Multiple Fracture Ribs.,"Background


The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral melatonin administered with thoracic epidural analgesia in patients with multiple bilateral fractured ribs.
Patients and Methods


A prospective, double-blind randomized control study was carried out on 80 patients of either sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Grade I and II, aged above 18 years, presenting with multiple bilateral fractured ribs. They were randomly divided into two groups, 40 patients each. Placebo group patients received oral placebo tablets and melatonin group (TEA and melatonin) patients received oral melatonin tablets (5 mg), about 1 hour before epidural infusion of local anesthetics and then every 12 hours till the cessation of bupivacaine infusion.
Results


Melatonin administration was associated with a significant decrease in total morphine analgesia consumption, from 31.8 ± 1.41 mg in the TE group to 13.03 ± 0.85 mg in the melatonin group (P < 0.001), with a significant decrease (P < 0.001) in the mean infusion rate of bupivacaine required for controlling the pain, from 0.17 ± 0.014 mL/kg/hour in the TE group to 0.12 ± 0.001 mL/kg/hour in the melatonin group. The duration of bupivacaine infusion in the melatonin group was also significantly shorter than in the TE group (96.48 ± 1.87 and 100.05 ± 3.39 hours, resp., P < 0.001).
Conclusion


We conclude that premedication of patients with 5 mg melatonin is associated with significant prolongation of thoracic epidural analgesic effects compared to placebo.

69,32342053,Shear Bond Strength of Brackets Bonded with Self-Etching Primers Compared to Conventional Acid-Etch Technique: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Objectives


The purpose of this randomized clinical trial (RCT) was to compare the shear bond strength (SBS) of orthodontic brackets bonded to enamel with conventional acid-etch (AE) technique and self-etching primers (SEP).
Materials and Methods


Twenty-two patients, requiring extraction of two bicuspids for orthodontic reasons, were recruited. In each individual, following blinding and allocation concealment, one intact premolar received conventional AE, whereas the contralateral premolar received SEP with a split-mouth design. Bonded brackets remained in the oral cavity for two months. Afterward, the teeth were extracted without debonding the brackets. SBS and adhesive remnant index (ARI) were measured using a Universal Instron machine and a stereomicroscope, respectively.
Results


The mean SBS of the conventional AE and SEP groups was 9.53 and 9.20 MPa, respectively. Paired t-test showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups (P=0.096). Comparison of ARI between the two groups, using Wilcoxon test, indicated that significantly less adhesive remained on enamel with brackets bonded with SEP compared to brackets bonded with conventional AE (P<0.001) although the SBS was higher in the AE group.
Conclusion


The present study indicated that although there is no significant difference in SBS between SEP and conventional AE for bonding orthodontic metal brackets, the amount of residual adhesive on the enamel surface is significantly less with SEP than with conventional AE.(IRCT registration number: IRCT201705099086N3).",2019,"Comparison of ARI between the two groups, using Wilcoxon test, indicated that significantly less adhesive remained on enamel with brackets bonded with SEP compared to brackets bonded with conventional AE (P<0.001) although the SBS was higher in the AE group.

70,32342054,A Comparative Study of Low-Level Laser Therapy and Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation as an Adjunct to Pharmaceutical Therapy for Myofascial Pain Dysfunction Syndrome: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Objectives


Myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome (MPDS) is the most common form of temporomandibular disorders. Because of the multifactorial nature of the problem, its management usually involves several treatment modalities to maximize their synergistic effects. This randomized clinical trial aimed to assess the efficacy of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) as an adjunct to pharmaceutical therapy for treatment of MPDS.
Materials and Methods


This clinical trial evaluated 108 MPDS patients. First, the initial pain intensity of patients was determined using a visual analogue scale (VAS). The first phase of the study included education, awareness, self-care, behavior and relaxation therapy. After 1 month, the pain score was measured again using VAS. Patients who acquired a pain score >1 were divided into three groups of LLLT with diode (GAAlAr) laser with 0.2 W power, TENS, and control, using block randomization. All groups received 10 mg fluoxetine once daily, 0.25 mg clonazepam once daily and 10 mg baclofen three times a day. ANOVA was used to compare the recovery rate of the three groups.
Results


Pain in the trapezius muscle and pain on mouth opening resolved faster in the laser + medication group. The recovery rate was faster in the mean muscle pain, general pain reported by patients, pain in the masseter and pterygoid muscles and pain and limitation in lateral movements in both laser + medication and TENS groups.
Conclusion

This study aimed to assess the effect of three commonly consumed beverages on surface roughness of polished and glazed zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate (ZLS) glass ceramics.
Materials and Methods


In this experimental study, 104 rectangular specimens were cut from Vita Suprinity blocks with 2 mm thickness. After ultrasonic cleaning and firing of the specimens, they were finished and polished in two groups. Specimens in the first group were polished using a 2-step polishing kit while the second group specimens were glazed and heated in a porcelain firing oven according to the manufacturer's instructions. Baseline surface roughness was measured using a profilometer. Specimens in each group were then randomly divided into 4 subgroups (n=13) for immersion in artificial saliva (control group), cola, orange juice and black tea. Surface roughness was measured again and data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA.
Results


The highest and the lowest mean Ra were found in orange juice and saliva subgroups, respectively in both glazed and polished groups. The Ra values of both polished and glazed groups significantly increased after immersion in orange juice and cola (P<0.05). The polished surfaces showed insignificantly higher surface roughness compared with glazed surfaces (P>0.05).
Conclusion

72,32342247,Investigation of fluctuations in blood glucose level due to dietary restrictions during impacted mandibular third molar extraction under intravenous sedation: effect of perioperative glucose administration.,"OBJECTIVE


We aimed to investigate the usefulness of glucose administration for maintaining perioperative glycemic control in patients with dietary restrictions during 4 h prior to impacted mandibular third molar extraction under intravenous sedation.
METHODS


Fifty-four individuals scheduled to undergo extraction of impacted mandibular third molars under intravenous sedation, with preoperative blood glucose levels (GL) of 70-110 mg/dL, were evaluated and divided into 3 groups (n = 18 each): control group receiving glucose-free sodium lactate Ringer's solution, perioperative GL group receiving 100 mL of 5% glucose solution immediately after local anesthesia, and postoperative GL group receiving 100 mL of 5% glucose solution immediately after surgery completion. Blood glucose levels, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were measured.
RESULTS


Glucose levels of those in the control and perioperative GL groups decreased within the standard range 90 min after surgery, compared with the preoperative blood glucose level. However, in the postoperative GL group, glucose levels were similar to the preoperative levels. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were not affected by glucose administration, and sedation could be maintained without an invasive procedure.
CONCLUSIONS


Following a restriction on eating and drinking 4 h prior to surgery, the blood glucose level gradually decreased in the perioperative period but remained within the reference range until 90 min following surgery.

73,32342253,The association of primary tumor site with acute adverse event and efficacy of definitive chemoradiotherapy for cStage II/III esophageal cancer: an exploratory analysis of JCOG0909.,"BACKGROUND


JCOG0909 is a phase II trial of definitive chemoradiotherapy including salvage treatment for cStage II-III thoracic esophageal cancer; the radiation field for elective regional lymph node irradiation, which can affect patient outcome and adverse event, varied based on the primary tumor site, i.e., upper (Ut), middle (Mt), and lower thoracic (Lt) esophagus. The impact of different primary sites on the safety and efficacy of definitive chemoradiotherapy in JCOG0909 is not well characterized.
METHODS


Patients were categorized into three groups (Ut, Mt, and Lt) according to the primary tumor location. We compared acute adverse events during definitive chemoradiotherapy, complete response (CR) rate, 3-year progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) among the 3 groups.
RESULTS


Out of the 96 patients enrolled in JCOG0909 between April 2010 and August 2014, 94 patients (16, 59, and 19 patients in the Ut, Mt, and Lt groups, respectively) were included in this exploratory analysis. The proportion of patients with cStage III was 25% in the Ut, 37% in the Mt, and 47% in the Lt group. Grade 3-4 leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were more frequently observed in the Mt (66%, 54%, and 15%) and Lt groups (84%, 68%, and 16%) than in the Ut group (38%, 44%, and 0%). There was no significant between-group difference with respect to 3-year OS (73.3%, 77.9%, and 57.9%), 3-year PFS (60.0%, 59.3%, and 47.4%), or CR rate (62.5%, 62.7%, and 42.1%).

74,32342255,Combined aspirin and clopidogrel therapy in phacoemulsification cataract surgery: a risk factor for ocular hemorrhage?,"PURPOSE


To evaluate the safety of phacoemulsification cataract surgery in the patients undergoing dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel.
METHODS


Consecutive patients undergoing phacoemulsification cataract surgery with a clear corneal incision under topical anesthesia were eligible for inclusion in the study. Thirty-eight eyes from 38 patients on combined aspirin and clopidogrel therapy who continued the treatment were classified into the maintenance group, a matched group of 38 eyes from 38 patients on no antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy as the control group. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and incidences of complications were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS


There was no significant difference in final BCVA between the maintenance group and the control group (p = 0.178). No significant difference existed in the incidences of hemorrhagic or non-hemorrhagic complications between the two groups (p = 0.529 and p = 0.589, respectively). Moreover, no surgery was postponed or cancelled due to hemorrhagic complications in either group, and no cardiovascular events occurred during the follow-up. There was no case of anterior chamber hemorrhage, vitreous hemorrhage, or suprachoroidal hemorrhage.

75,32342266,Application of Vitamin E Acetate on Staple Lines and Anastomoses of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: Impact on Postoperative Pain and Acute Phase Reactants.,"PURPOSE


Postoperative pain after laparoscopic surgery has 3 components: parietal, visceral, and associated with pneumoperitoneum. Visceral pain accounts for around 30% of the total pain and is less amenable to be controlled by multimodal analgesia. The topical application of vitamin E ointment has demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect in the local inflammatory response against surgical aggression. Vitamin E has been also associated with a reduction in postoperative pain of skin wounds. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the topical application of vitamin E acetate on staple lines and anastomoses of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, as part of a multimodal analgesia scheme within an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) program.
METHODS


A prospective randomized clinical trial was performed. Patients were divided into 2 groups: patients receiving a topical application of vitamin E on staple lines and anastomoses (G1) and patients not receiving it (G2). The primary endpoint was postoperative pain, as measured by VAS 24 h after surgery. Secondary outcomes include morphine rescue needs, acute phase reactants 24 h after surgery, and hospital stay.
RESULTS


One hundred forty patients were included, 70 in each group. Postoperative pain was 10 mm in G1 and 21.8 mm in G2 (p < 0.001). Morphine needs within the first 24 h were 2.9% in G1 and 13.2% in G2 (p = 0.026). C-reactive protein levels were significantly lower in G1 (8.7 mg/dL vs 11.9; p = 0.016). Mean hospital stay was 2.1 days in G1 and 2.9 in G2 (p = 0.019).
CONCLUSION


Topical application of vitamin E reduces postoperative pain and acute phase reactants, allowing an earlier discharge.

76,31283831,"Social Engagement, Cognition, Depression, and Comorbidity in Nursing Home Residents With Sensory Impairment.","Sensory impairment, explicitly vision and hearing impairment, among nursing home (NH) residents decreases their ability to socially engage. However, it is not known to what extent visual, hearing, or dual impairment is associated with social engagement. The aims of the current retrospective, cross-sectional descriptive study were to determine the relationship between social engagement and (a) levels of sensory impairment (vision, hearing, and dual); (b) depression; and (c) cognition. The authors analyzed baseline data from 213 NH residents with sensory impairment from the I-SEE study. Multivariable model results demonstrated that sensory impairment was not associated with social engagement when adjusting for all covariates.

77,31369510,Predictors of Speech Outcome in Posterior Pharyngeal Fat Graft Surgery for Velopharyngeal Insufficiency Management.,"BACKGROUND


The identification of variables potentially correlated with speech outcome, following posterior pharyngeal fat grafting for treatment of velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI), can provide useful information to guide decision-making and preoperative counseling. This study assessed the predictors of speech outcome after posterior pharyngeal fat grafting for VPI management.
METHODS


One hundred and sixty-seven consecutive patients with repaired cleft palate and VPI who underwent posterior pharyngeal fat grafting were retrospectively enrolled. Perceptual speech and nasendoscopic parameters were randomly rated by 3 blinded evaluators. Speech outcome was stratified based on previously published criteria. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of 15-month postoperative speech outcomes.
RESULTS


Large velopharyngeal gap, higher number of previous palatal surgical procedures, and referral pattern (ie, patients who underwent primary palatoplasty elsewhere) were independently negative (for all, P < 0.05) predictors of speech outcome, whereas small velopharyngeal gap size was positively (P < 0.05) correlated with this outcome. Age, sex, race, Veau hierarchy, syndromic diagnosis, Angle classification of malocclusion, type of primary palatoplasty, body mass index, obstructive sleep apnea-related scores, surgical period, donor site, grafted volume, recipient site-related complications, and preoperative status (velopharyngeal closure pattern, hypernasality, audible nasal emissions, and intraoral pressure) were not associated (for all, P > 0.05) with speech outcomes.
CONCLUSION


Posterior pharyngeal fat grafting improves speech function in patients with VPI, whereas gap size, number of previous palatal surgeries, and referral pattern affect the speech outcome.",2020,"CONCLUSION

79,32340638,Targeting excessive worry with internet-based extinction therapy: a randomised controlled trial with mediation analysis and economical evaluation.,"BACKGROUND


Excessive worry is a common phenomenon. Our research group has previously developed an online intervention for excessive worry based on operant principles of extinction (IbET; internet-based extinction therapy) and tested it against a waiting-list. The aim of this study was to evaluate IbET against an active control comparator (CTRL).
METHODS


A 10-week parallel participant blind randomised controlled trial with health-economical evaluation and mediation analyses. Participants (N = 311) were randomised (ratio 4.5:4.5:1) to IbET, to CTRL (an internet-based stress-management training program) or to waiting-list. The nation-wide trial included self-referred adults with excessive worry. The primary outcome was change in worry assessed with the Penn State Worry Questionnaire from baseline to 10 weeks.
RESULTS


IbET had greater reductions in worry compared to CTRL [-3.6 point difference, (95% CI -2.4 to -4.9)] and also a significantly larger degree of treatment responders [63% v. 51%; risk ratio = 1.24 (95% CI 1.01-1.53)]. Both IbET and CTRL made large reductions in worry compared to waiting-list and effects were sustained up to 1 year. Treatment credibility, therapist attention, compliance and working alliance were equal between IbET and CTRL. Data attrition was 4% at the primary endpoint. The effects of IbET were mediated by the hypothesized causal mechanism (reduced thought suppression) but not by competing mediators. Health-economical evaluation indicated that IbET had a 99% chance of being cost-effective compared to CTRL given societal willingness to pay of 1000€.

80,32340640,Impact of a nutrition education programme on preschool children's willingness to consume fruits and vegetables.,"OBJECTIVE


To evaluate the impact of a preschool-based nutrition education programme consisting of twelve 'hands on' nutrition education lessons delivered during the school year on young children's willingness to consume fruits and vegetables.
DESIGN


Quasi-experimental, pre-post design including the collection of plate waste evaluation data at the start and end of the 2015-2016 school year within two groups: (1) randomly selected classrooms receiving the intervention and (2) within conveniently sampled preschool classrooms not receiving the intervention serving as a comparison group.
SETTING


Centre-based preschool programmes serving low-income families in the Denver metro area.
PARTICIPANTS


Three- to five-year-old children in preschool classrooms participating in the intervention during the 2015-2016 school year (n 308) and children enrolled in comparison classrooms (n 215).
RESULTS


Repeated-measures logit models assessed whether increases in the odds of consuming small samples of fruits and vegetables between Time 1 (pre-intervention) and Time 2 (post-intervention) were different for children within the intervention group compared with the comparison group. Analyses showed that the change over time in consumption of the three vegetable samples varied by intervention status with greater change occurring among children within the intervention group (edamame: P = 0·001; cauliflower: P ≤ 0·0001 and red pepper: P ≤ 0·0001). Unlike vegetables, the change over time in consumption of the two fruit samples was not different between children within the intervention and comparison groups.

This study aimed to determine the effect of cold application time on symptoms, edema, and patient satisfaction in soft tissue injuries.
METHODS


A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 105 patients who were treated with cold applications of different durations (10, 20, and 30 minutes). Interview-assisted data were collected on symptoms and patient satisfaction. Edema and range of motion were objectively measured in patients with an ankle injury. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance.
RESULTS


Pain reduction was greatest in the 20 minutes of cold application group (F = 46,350, P < 0.05). Symptoms of discomfort such as tingling (F = 65,928, P < 0.05), redness (F = 61,954, P < 0.05), itching (F = 36,488, P < 0.05), numbness (F = 57,937, P < 0.05), and burning (F = 55,399, P < 0.05) were more frequent in the group with 30 minutes of cold application. Both joint mobility (F = 45,283, P < 0.05) and patient satisfaction (F = 130,987, P < 0.05) were the highest in the group with 20 minutes of cold application.

83,32340781,OPtical frequency domain imaging vs. INtravascular ultrasound in percutaneous coronary InterventiON in patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND


A recent clinical trial demonstrated that optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) guidance in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is noninferior to intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guidance in patients with coronary artery disease with regard to target vessel failure (composed of cardiac death, myocardial infarction attributed to the target vessel, and clinically-driven target vessel revascularization) at 12 months. The impact of OFDI guidance in PCI for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains uncertain.
METHODS


OPINION ACS is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel group, non-inferiority trial in Japan. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive either OFDI- or IVUS-guided PCI. PCI is performed using the sirolimus-eluting stent in accordance with certain OFDI and IVUS criteria for optimal stent deployment.

84,32341691,Teduglutide for the treatment of adults with intestinal failure associated with short bowel syndrome: pooled safety data from four clinical trials.,"Background


In multiple clinical studies, teduglutide reduced parenteral support (PS) with a consistent safety profile in adults with short bowel syndrome-associated intestinal failure (SBS-IF). The objective of this study was to assess adverse events (AEs) from a pooled data set.
Methods


Safety data from four prospective clinical trials of teduglutide in patients with SBS-IF were assimilated. AEs were evaluated in patient groups based on treatment received in each study and in populations stratified to create distinct subgroups based on aetiology, bowel anatomy and baseline PS volume requirements.
Results


Safety data are reported for up to 2.5 years, totalling 222 person-years exposure to teduglutide. In most patients, AEs were reported as mild or moderate in severity in all patient groups and occurred at comparable rates between patients who received teduglutide or placebo. Several common gastrointestinal AEs, including abdominal pain, nausea and abdominal distension, were reported more frequently earlier in the course of treatment, with their frequency declining over time. Fewer gastrointestinal AEs were reported in patients with vascular causes of SBS-IF and patients with most of their colon-in-continuity than in other patient subgroups. Across the patient stratification subgroups, the predominant treatment-emergent AEs for which patients receiving teduglutide had a significantly increased relative risk were abdominal distension and gastrointestinal stoma complication compared with patients receiving placebo.
Conclusions


Teduglutide had a safety profile consistent with prior adult data and no new safety concerns were identified. The most frequently reported AEs were gastrointestinal in origin, consistent with the underlying disease condition and intestinotrophic actions of teduglutide.

85,32341707,The Effect of Music Therapy and Aromatherapy with Chamomile-Lavender Essential Oil on the Anxiety of Clinical Nurses: A Randomized and Double-Blind Clinical Trial.,"Nurses may be anxious due to critical and emergencies, and anxiety can affect their professional performance. Non-pharmacological interventions, as a safe method, can reduce anxiety. This study aimed to determine the effect of music therapy and aromatherapy with chamomile - lavender essential oil on the anxiety of clinical nurses. This was a randomized, double-blind clinical trial. One hundred twenty nurses from clinical wards of Besat Hospital in Sanandaj, Iran, were selected between 2018 and 2019 by purposeful sampling. The samples were randomly assigned to three groups with different interventions, namely music therapy, both aromatherapy with chamomile-lavender essential oil and music therapy, and aromatherapy with chamomile-lavender essential oil, along with a control group as well. The anxiety of nurses was measured based on the Beck Anxiety Inventory before the intervention and after three work shifts. The data were analyzed using the SPSS v.22 software. One-way ANOVA was used to test the hypotheses. The findings showed that the mean scores of the anxiety of nurses after the intervention in the three groups namely the group for which music therapy was applied, the group for which aromatherapy with chamomile-lavender essential oil was used and the group for which both music therapy and aromatherapy with chamomile-lavender essential oil were applied, were (39.28), (37.82) and (40.03), respectively. Therefore, the obtained mean score of each group was significantly lower than that of the control group (56.08) (p < 0.0001).

86,32341794,Hypoxia is not the primary mechanism contributing to exercise-induced proteinuria.,"Introduction


Proteinuria increases at altitude and with exercise, potentially as a result of hypoxia. Using urinary alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (α1-AGP) levels as a sensitive marker of proteinuria, we examined the impact of relative hypoxia due to high altitude and blood pressure-lowering medication on post-exercise proteinuria.
Methods


Twenty individuals were pair-matched for sex, age and ACE genotype. They completed maximal exercise tests once at sea level and twice at altitude (5035 m). Losartan (100 mg/day; angiotensin-receptor blocker) and placebo were randomly assigned within each pair 21 days before ascent. The first altitude exercise test was completed within 24-48 hours of arrival (each pair within ~1 hour). Acetazolamide (125 mg two times per day) was administrated immediately after this test for 48 hours until the second altitude exercise test.
Results


With placebo, post-exercise α1-AGP levels were similar at sea level and altitude. Odds ratio (OR) for increased resting α1-AGP at altitude versus sea level was greater without losartan (2.16 times greater). At altitude, OR for reduced post-exercise α1-AGP (58% lower) was higher with losartan than placebo (2.25 times greater, p=0.059) despite similar pulse oximetry (SpO 2 ) (p=0.95) between groups. Acetazolamide reduced post-exercise proteinuria by approximately threefold (9.3±9.7 vs 3.6±6.0 μg/min; p=0.025) although changes were not correlated (r=-0.10) with significant improvements in SpO 2  (69.1%±4.5% vs 75.8%±3.8%; p=0.001).
Discussion


Profound systemic hypoxia imposed by altitude does not result in greater post-exercise proteinuria than sea level. Losartan and acetazolamide may attenuate post-exercise proteinuria, however further research is warranted.",2020,"At altitude, OR for reduced post-exercise α1-AGP (58% lower) was higher with losartan

87,32341801,Game on: a cycling exergame can elicit moderate-to-vigorous intensity. A pilot study.,"Objectives


The aims of this pilot study were to investigate oxygen uptake (V̇O 2 ) while playing a cycling exergame to assess exercise intensity to determine its potential as a feasible exercise alternative to improve aerobic fitness, and to assess the validity of using heart rate (HR) to estimate V̇O 2  in exergaming.
Methods


Five males (age: 32±8; peak oxygen uptake (V̇O 2peak ): 47.9±7.8 mL·kg -1 ·min -1 ) and five females (age: 27±3; V̇O 2peak : 33.9±4.6 mL·kg -1 ·min -1 ) played the cycling exergame 'Pedal Tanks' for 45 min, with measurements of HR and V̇O 2 .
Results


Average and peak V̇O 2  during exergaming were 61.7±10.1% and 78.3±11.7% of V̇O 2peak , respectively, whereas average and peak HR were 80.0±9.4% and 91.5%±6.7% of HR peak . There was a strong positive correlation between V̇O 2  and HR for all participants (p<0.05) although estimated V̇O 2  from HR was 9% higher than that measured during exergaming.
Conclusion

88,31114694,Post hoc efficacy and safety analysis of insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed- ratio combination in North American patients compared with the rest of world.,"Objective


To assess the efficacy and safety of iGlarLixi (titratable fixed-ratio combination of insulin glargine (iGlar) and lixisenatide) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) living in North America (NA; USA and Canada) compared with the rest of the world (RoW).
Research design and methods


Post hoc analysis included patient-level data from 509 sites/centers across two phase III trials: LixiLan-O (NCT02058147; insulin-naive patients; NA, n=371; RoW, n=796) and LixiLan-L (NCT02058160; inadequately controlled patients on basal insulin; NA, n=196; RoW, n=535). Efficacy outcomes were: change from baseline to Week 30 in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), postprandial glucose (PPG), PPG excursions, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and body weight; proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <42 mmol/mol (<7.0%); proportion of patients achieving composite endpoint: HbA1c <42 mmol/mol (<7.0%), no weight gain or symptomatic hypoglycemia (blood glucose ≤3.9 mmol/L (≤70 mg/dL)). Safety endpoints included incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events.
Results


Significantly larger reductions (p≤0.003) in HbA1c from baseline to Week 30 were achieved with iGlarLixi, compared with iGlar or lixisenatide, in NA and RoW patients in LixiLan-O (iGlarLixi vs iGlar: -0.31 and -0.29, respectively; iGlarLixi vs lixisenatide: -0.84 and -0.69, respectively) and in LixiLan-L (iGlarLixi vs iGlar: -0.5 and -0.51, respectively). Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia was similar between NA and RoW patients. iGlarLixi resulted in significant weight benefits versus iGlar (change from baseline -1.58 and -1.29 kg for NA and RoW patients, respectively; p < 0.001). GI adverse events were similar for iGlarLixi and iGlar, but significantly higher for lixisenatide.
Conclusions


iGlarLixi improved glycemic parameters versus iGlar or lixisenatide alone in both NA and RoW patients, with beneficial weight effects versus iGlar. iGlarLixi treatment responses, hypoglycemia risk and GI adverse events in NA patients were comparable with patients in the RoW.

89,31119758,Taking the fight out of people: Exploring how defeat modulates the automatic aggressive response to facial anger.,"Past studies indicate that angry facial expressions automatically activate an aggressive response, seeming to support the view that humans possess an inborn, automatic tendencies to aggress. However, the current authors drew on influential models from evolutionary game theory to suggest that experiences of defeat may modulate this tendency. To examine this, four experiments were conducted to explore how defeat may modulate this aggressive response. In each study, participants executed simulated fight or flight responses based a computerized opponent's facial expression. Across studies, participants were typically faster to initiate fight (than flight) responses against an angry opponent. Simply losing simulated fights (Experiment 1) or experiencing aversive, white noise following simulated losses (Experiment 2) did not eliminate this tendency. However, when aversive noise was specifically experienced after losing to an angry opponent, the automatic aggressive response was eliminated (Experiment 3). This result was directly replicated (Experiment 4). Thus, these studies isolate the cues which automatize submissive behavior and show that fighting experience can modulate even our automatic aggressive responses to others' anger displays.",2019,"Simply losing simulated fights (Experiment 1) or experiencing aversive, white noise following simulated losses (Experiment 2) did not eliminate this tendency.",[],[],['automatic aggressive response'],[],[],"[{'cui': 'C0205554', 'cui_str': 'Automated'}, {'cui': 'C0001807', 'cui_str': 'Aggressive behavior'}]",4.0,0.0146639,"Simply losing simulated fights (Experiment 1) or experiencing aversive, white noise following simulated losses (Experiment 2) did not eliminate this tendency.","[{'ForeName': 'Benjamin M', 'Initials': 'BM', 'LastName': 'Wilkowski', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming.'}, {'ForeName': 'Elizabeth L', 'Initials': 'EL', 'LastName': 'Leki', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming.'}]",Aggressive behavior,['10.1002/ab.21842']

Results revealed that male-but not female-participants who were rejected by desired dating partners displayed increased hostility. This pattern of findings was consistent across different measures, which considered both aggressive tendencies against the rejecting partners and hostile attitudes against the opposite gender.

91,31262439,Coping with everyday life and physical activity in the aftermath of an acute pulmonary embolism: A qualitative study exploring patients' perceptions and coping strategies.,"INTRODUCTION


There is an increasing awareness that patients with acute pulmonary embolism (APE) suffer long-term consequences like fatigue, anxiety, and reduced physical capacity. However, we lack knowledge on how patients manage everyday life and physical activity following an APE. The study aimed to explore how patients experience and cope with daily life and physical activity in the first year following an APE.
MATERIALS AND METHODS


Semi-structured individual interviews were performed with 16 patients, 6-12 months after a first-time APE event. The methodological framework for the analysis was interpretive description.
RESULTS


Most participants had managed to return to their daily routines at the time of the interview, although some struggled more than others. They experienced their daily life and well-being to be negatively affected by fatigue, anxious thoughts and bodily hypervigilance, and were concerned about themselves, their family, friends and life situation. In many cases, they lacked advice from health professionals. Participants used various strategies for re-engaging in everyday life and physical activities, reflecting their physical and mental resources, contextual support, and different life situation. One central theme was the challenge of coming to terms with a more vulnerable identity, and adjusting this identity to established family and work roles.
CONCLUSIONS


Most participants had managed to resume their everyday life 6-12 months after the APE event, but were still limited in their daily activities and found it difficult to sustain a sufficient level of physical activity. They described different barriers and facilitators, which should be addressed in future rehabilitation interventions.",2019,"They experienced their daily life and well-being to be negatively affected by fatigue, anxious thoughts and bodily hypervigilance, and were concerned about themselves, their family, friends and life situation.","['patients with acute pulmonary embolism (APE', 'Semi-structured individual interviews were performed with 16 patients, 6-12\u202fmonths after a first-time APE event', 'acute pulmonary embolism']",['Coping with everyday life and physical activity'],"['fatigue, anxious thoughts and bodily hypervigilance']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C2882221', 'cui_str': 'Acute pulmonary embolism'}, {'cui': 'C0027361', 'cui_str': 'Person'}, {'cui': 'C0021822', 'cui_str': 'Interviews as Topic'}, {'cui': 'C0884358', 'cui_str': 'Performed'}, {'cui': 'C0332177', 'cui_str': 'Monthly'}, {'cui': 'C0040223', 'cui_str': 'Time'}, {'cui': 'C0441471', 'cui_str': 'Event'}]","[{'cui': 'C0009967', 'cui_str': 'Coping behavior'}, {'cui': 'C0332173', 'cui_str': 'Daily'}, {'cui': 'C0376558', 'cui_str': 'Life'}, {'cui': 'C0015259', 'cui_str': 'Exercise'}]","[{'cui': 'C0015672', 'cui_str': 'Fatigue'}, {'cui': 'C0003467', 'cui_str': 'Anxiety'}, {'cui': 'C0039869', 'cui_str': 'Thinking'}, {'cui': 'C0235013', 'cui_str': 'Hypervigilance'}]",16.0,0.0364118,"They experienced their daily life and well-being to be negatively affected by fatigue, anxious thoughts and bodily hypervigilance, and were concerned about themselves, their family, friends and life situation.","[{'ForeName': 'Nanna', 'Initials': 'N', 'LastName': 'Rolving', 'Affiliation': 'Diagnostic Centre, Silkeborg Regional Hospital, Silkeborg, Denmark; DEFACTUM, Aarhus, Denmark.

92,31270136,Automatic Measurement of Kidney and Liver Volumes from MR Images of Patients Affected by Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.,"BACKGROUND


The formation and growth of cysts in kidneys, and often liver, in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) cause progressive increases in total kidney volume (TKV) and liver volume (TLV). Laborious and time-consuming manual tracing of kidneys and liver is the current gold standard. We developed a fully automated segmentation method for TKV and TLV measurement that uses a deep learning network optimized to perform semantic segmentation of kidneys and liver.
METHODS


We used 80% of a set of 440 abdominal magnetic resonance images (T2-weighted HASTE coronal sequences) from patients with ADPKD to train the network and the remaining 20% for validation. Both kidneys and liver were also segmented manually. To evaluate the method's performance, we used an additional test set of images from 100 patients, 45 of whom were also involved in longitudinal analyses.
RESULTS


TKV and TLV measured by the automated approach correlated highly with manually traced TKV and TLV (intraclass correlation coefficients, 0.998 and 0.996, respectively), with low bias and high precision (<0.1%±2.7% for TKV and -1.6%±3.1% for TLV); this was comparable with inter-reader variability of manual tracing (<0.1%±3.5% for TKV and -1.5%±4.8% for TLV). For longitudinal analysis, bias and precision were <0.1%±3.2% for TKV and 1.4%±2.9% for TLV growth.
CONCLUSIONS


These findings demonstrate a fully automated segmentation method that measures TKV, TLV, and changes in these parameters as accurately as manual tracing. This technique may facilitate future studies in which automated and reproducible TKV and TLV measurements are needed to assess disease severity, disease progression, and treatment response.",2019,"RESULTS

93,32338944,Using intraindividual variability as an indicator of cognitive improvement in a physical exercise intervention of older women with mild cognitive impairment.,"OBJECTIVES


Intervention programs designed to improve cognitive ability in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have often focused on physical exercise as a means to improve traditional measures of cognition, with mixed success. Individuals with MCI show high levels of intraindividual variability (IIV) in response speed, and IIV may be sensitive to intervention-related changes. The current study evaluated if participants who participated in a physical activity intervention (aerobic or resistance training) showed a reduction in IIV, compared to a balance and tone control group.
METHOD


This study was a secondary analysis of the EXercise for Cognition and Everyday Living (EXCEL) Study. Women Aged 70-80 years with probable MCI ( n  = 86) participated in a 6-month randomized controlled trial designed to investigate the effects of different physical exercises on cognitive ability. Participants completed 1-back, task switching, and spatial working memory tasks at baseline, 13 weeks (midpoint) and upon completion of the program.
RESULTS


Analyses were conducted following both the intent-to-treat principle and complier average casual effect (CACE) modeling. Participants in the intervention group who complied with the program showed reduced IIV on task switching in the CACE models. The intent-to-treat analyses were all nonsignificant.
CONCLUSIONS


Physical exercise resulted in improved IIV in older adults with probable MCI, showing that IIV is modifiable by lifestyle engagement. IIV may be a useful complementary index of cognitive plasticity particularly among those with cognitive impairment.

In this prospective study, 181 patients were included and they chose the treatment by themselves.

Semen parameters, serum T level and IIEF-5 scores were recorded before and 6 months after the operation. Results showed that MSV with or without TD could improve semen quality, serum T level and IIEF-5 score. For semen quality 6 months after the operation, there was no significant difference between patients received MSV with or without TD. But in patients with varicocele of grade III, MSV without testicular delivery improved the sperm concentration and motility more.

95,32339359,A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of the PTSD Coach App Following Motor Vehicle Crash-Related Injury.,"OBJECTIVE


Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (PTSS) are common after minor injuries and can impair recovery. We sought to understand whether an evidence-based mobile phone application with self-help tools (PTSD Coach) could be useful to improve recovery after acute trauma among injured emergency department (ED) patients. This pilot study examined the feasibility, acceptability and potential benefit of using PTSD Coach among acutely injured motor-vehicle crash (MVC) patients.
METHODS


From September 2017-September 2018, we recruited adult patients within 24 hours post-MVC from the EDs of two Level 1 trauma centers in the United States. We randomly assigned 64 injured adults to either the PTSD Coach (n = 33) or treatment as usual (TAU; n = 31) condition. We assessed PTSD symptoms (PTSS) and associated symptoms at 1-month (83% retained) and 3-months (73% retained) post-enrollment.
RESULTS


Enrollment was feasible (74% of eligible subjects participated) but usability and engagement were low (67% used PTSD Coach at least once, primarily in week 1); 76% of those who used it rated the app as moderately to extremely helpful. No differences emerged between groups in PTSS outcomes. Exploratory analyses among Black subjects (n = 21) indicated that those in the PTSD Coach condition (versus TAU) reported marginally lower PTSS (95% CI: -0.30; 37.77) and higher PTSS coping self-efficacy (95%CI: -58.20; -3.61) at 3-months.
CONCLUSIONS


We demonstrated feasibility to recruit acutely injured ED patients into an app-based intervention study, yet mixed evidence emerged for the usability and benefit of PTSD Coach.

96,32339370,Histology of augmented autogenous bone covered by a platelet-rich fibrin membrane or deproteinized bovine bone mineral and a collagen membrane: A pilot randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVES


This study aimed to evaluate histologic and histomorphometric bone characteristics with a focus on vitality after lateral alveolar ridge augmentation using an autogenous bone graft as a block covered by either a platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) membrane (test group) or a standard procedure involving coverage of the bone block with a deproteinized bovine bone mineral and a resorbable collagen membrane (control group).
MATERIAL AND METHODS


A total of 27 (test = 14, control = 13) partially edentulous patients with indication for bone block augmentation before implant installation were included. For analyses, a biopsy of augmented bone was retrieved six months after bone grafting.
RESULTS


Histologic evaluation of augmented bone revealed a predominance of non-vital bone towards the periosteum and few localized areas of vital bone in the center of the graft in both groups. In contrast, augmented bone towards the native bone demonstrated extensive bone remodeling in both groups. Histomorphometric analyses demonstrated a mean of 14% vital bone, 80% non-vital bone, 5% soft tissue, and 1% blood vessels in the test group. In the control group, the corresponding shares were 14% vital bone, 63% non-vital bone, 22% soft tissue, and 1% blood vessels. We observed no significant differences between the groups (p>0.05).
CONCLUSION


In conclusion, a comparable low bone vitality of augmented bone was observed in the PRF and in the control group. Consequently, the present study could not verify the potential beneficial effect of a PRF membrane on bone vitality of an autogenous bone graft used as a block.",2020,"RESULTS

98,32339943,Effect of increased relative stiffness of the lumbar spine on hamstring muscle stretching in individuals with a history of low back pain suspected to have a clinical lumbar instability: A randomized crossover design.,"BACKGROUND


Theoretically, lumbopelvic stabilization techniques during hamstring muscle stretching could increase lumbar stiffness relative to hamstring muscle in individuals with a history of low back pain and suspected clinical lumbar instability. However, evidence to support this theory is limited. This study aimed to 1) determine changes in lumbopelvic, lumbar, and hip motions, and hamstring muscle length after stretching exercises with lumbopelvic stiffening or relaxing techniques, and 2) compare those changes between techniques.
METHODS


This study used a randomized crossover design. Thirty-two participants with a history of low back pain and bilateral hamstring muscle tightness were recruited. The order of the first technique was randomly assigned. After a 2-day washout, participants were crossed over to the second technique. Motion data during active forward trunk bending and bilateral hamstring muscle length during passive knee extension were collected pre- and post-intervention.
FINDINGS


Significant increases (P < 0.05) were found in bilateral hamstring muscle length for both techniques. However, stiffening technique demonstrated a significant decrease in lumbar motion (P < 0.05) and increase in hip motion (P < 0.05), while relaxing technique demonstrated trends showing increases in lumbar and hip motions (P = 0.134 and 0.115, respectively). The findings showed significantly greater improvement (P < 0.05) in lumbar and hip motions with stiffening technique.
INTERPRETATION


The findings suggest increased relative stiffness of the lumbar spine during hamstring muscle stretching can specifically lengthen bilateral hamstring muscle and decrease excessive lumbar motion. This stiffening technique may prevent excessive movement of the lumbar spine, thereby reducing the risk of recurrent low back pain.",2020,"However, stiffening technique demonstrated a significant decrease in lumbar motion (P < 0.05) and increase in hip motion (P < 0.05), while relaxing technique demonstrated trends showing increases in lumbar and hip motions (P = 0.134 and 0.115, respectively).","['Thirty-two participants with a history of low back pain and bilateral hamstring muscle tightness were recruited', 'individuals with a history of low back pain suspected to have a clinical lumbar instability', 'individuals with a history of low back pain and suspected clinical lumbar instability']","['lumbar spine', 'hamstring muscle stretching']","['lumbar motion', 'excessive lumbar motion', 'hip motion', 'lumbopelvic, lumbar, and hip motions, and hamstring muscle length', 'bilateral hamstring muscle length', 'lumbar and hip motions']","[{'cui': 'C0450357', 'cui_str': '32'}, {'cui': 'C0262926', 'cui_str': 'History of'}, {'cui': 'C0024031', 'cui_str': 'Low back pain'}, {'cui': 'C0238767', 'cui_str': 'Right and left'}, {'cui': 'C0584895', 'cui_str': 'Posterior muscle of thigh structure'}, {'cui': 'C0439816', 'cui_str': 'Tightness sensation quality'}, {'cui': 'C0027361', 'cui_str': 'Person'}, {'cui': 'C0750491', 'cui_str': 'Suspected'}, {'cui': 'C0205210', 'cui_str': 'Clinical'}, {'cui': 'C0024090', 'cui_str': 'Lumbar'}, {'cui': 'C0085633', 'cui_str': 'Mood swings'}]","[{'cui': 'C0024091', 'cui_str': 'Bone structure of lumbar vertebra'}, {'cui': 'C0407178', 'cui_str': 'Stretching of muscle'}]","[{'cui': 'C0024090', 'cui_str': 'Lumbar'}, {'cui': 'C0026597', 'cui_str': 'Motion'}, {'cui': 'C0442802', 'cui_str': 'Excessive'}, {'cui': 'C0019552', 'cui_str': 'Bone structure of hip'}, {'cui': 'C0026845', 'cui_str': 'Muscle tissue'}, {'cui': 'C1444754', 'cui_str': 'Length'}, {'cui': 'C0238767', 'cui_str': 'Right and left'}, {'cui': 'C0584895', 'cui_str': 'Posterior muscle of thigh structure'}]",32.0,0.0268945,"However, stiffening technique demonstrated a significant decrease in lumbar motion (P < 0.05) and increase in hip motion (P < 0.05), while relaxing technique demonstrated trends showing increases in lumbar and hip motions (P = 0.134 and 0.115, respectively).","[{'ForeName': 'Peemongkon', 'Initials': 'P', 'LastName': 'Wattananon', 'Affiliation': 'Motor Control and Neural Plasticity Lab, Faculty of Physical Therapy, Mahidol University, 999 Phuttamonthon 4 Road, Salaya, Nakhon Pathom 73170, Thailand.

99,32339953,Effects of cardiopulmonary resuscitation training for Mozambican nursing students in a low-resource setting: An intervention study.,"BACKGROUND


There is an increasing incidence of cardiovascular diseases in Africa. Nurses' ability to undertake cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can significantly impact the survival of patients who experience cardiac arrest.
OBJECTIVES


We aimed to identify the effects of CPR training among Registered Nurse-Bachelor of Science in Nursing (RN-BSN) students in Mozambique.
DESIGN


A one-group pretest-posttest repeated-measures quasi-experimental design.
SETTING


Auditorium of a general hospital and 2 Anne manikins, but no automatic external defibrillator.
PARTICIPANTS


Thirty-two RN-BSN students.
METHODS


Students' attitudes and self-efficacy on CPR were measured by self-reported questionnaires three times (before, immediately after, and 20 weeks post intervention). Data were analyzed by the paired t-test and repeated-measures analysis of variance.
RESULTS


Attitude and self-efficacy scores of students on CPR significantly increased immediately after CPR training, but decreased 20 weeks after the intervention (p < .001). Sociodemographic characteristics did not significantly differ throughout the measurements of attitude or self-efficacy.
CONCLUSIONS


CPR manikin training positively affected attitude and self-efficacy in CPR among RN-BSN nursing students immediately, but not at 20 weeks, after the training. There is a need for research to repeatedly quantify parameters in a controlled study at different intervals and develop an instructor-training course customized to Mozambique.",2020,"RESULTS

100,32340075,Laparoscopic ablation or excision with helium thermal coagulator versus electrodiathermy for the treatment of mild-to-moderate endometriosis: randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE


To compare electrodiathermy with helium thermal coagulation in laparoscopic treatment of mild-to-moderate endometriosis.
DESIGN


Parallel-group randomized controlled trial.
SETTING


A UK endometriosis centre.
POPULATION


Non-pregnant women aged 16-50 with a clinical diagnosis of mild-to-moderate endometriosis.
METHODS


If mild or moderate endometriosis was confirmed at laparoscopy, women were randomized to laparoscopic treatment with electrodiathermy or helium thermal coagulator.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES


Cyclical pain and dyspareunia (rated on 100mm visual analogue scales), and quality of life, at baseline, 6, 12, and 36 weeks following surgery; operative blood loss; surgical complications.
RESULTS


192 women were randomized. 155 (81%) completed the primary outcome point at 12 weeks. In an intention-to-treat analysis, VAS scores for cyclical pain were significantly lower in the electrodiathermy group compared to the helium group at 12 weeks (mean difference = 9.43mm; 95% CI = 0.46, 18.40; p = 0.039) and across all timepoints (mean difference = 10.13mm; 95% CI = 3.48, 16.78; p = 0.003). A significant difference in dyspareunia also favoured electrodiathermy at 12 weeks (mean difference = 11.66mm; 95% CI 1.39, 21.93; p = 0.026). These effects were, however, smaller than the proposed minimum important difference of 18.00mm. Differences in some aspects of quality of life favoured electrodiathermy.

101,32340074,The FiCTION trial: Child oral health-related quality of life and dental anxiety across three treatment strategies for managing caries in young children.,"OBJECTIVES


The FiCTION trial compared co-primary outcomes (dental pain and/or infection) and secondary outcomes (child oral health-related quality of life [COHRQOL], child dental anxiety, cost-effectiveness, caries development/progression and acceptability) across three treatment strategies (Conventional with Prevention [C + P]; Biological with Prevention [B + P]; Prevention Alone [PA]) for managing caries in children in primary care. COHRQOL and child dental anxiety experiences are reported upon here.
METHODS


A multi-centre, 3-arm, parallel-group, unblinded patient-randomized controlled trial of 3- to 7-year-olds treated under NHS contracts was conducted in 72 general dental practices in England, Wales and Scotland. Child participants (with at least one primary molar with dentinal caries) were randomized (1:1:1) to one of three treatment arms with the intention of being managed according to allocated arm for 3 years (minimum 23 months). Randomization was via a centrally administered system using random permuted blocks of variable length. At baseline and final visit, accompanying parents/caregivers completed a parental questionnaire including COHRQOL (16 item P-CPQ-16), and at every visit, child- and parental-questionnaire-based data were collected for child-based dental trait and state anxiety. Statistical analyses were conducted on complete cases from the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis set.
RESULTS


A total of 1144 children were randomized (C + P: 386; B + P: 381; PA: 377). The mITT analysis set included the 1058 children who attended at least one study visit (C + P: 352; B + P: 352; PA: 354). Median follow-up was 33.8 months (IQR: 23.8, 36.7). The P-CPQ-16 overall score could be calculated after simple imputation at both baseline and final visit for 560 children (C + P: 189; B + P: 189; PA: 182). There was no evidence of a difference in the estimated adjusted mean P-CPQ-16 at the final visit which was, on average, 0.3 points higher (97.5% CI: -1.1 to 1.6) in B + P than C + P and 0.2 points higher, on average, (97.5% CI: -1.2 to 1.5) in PA than for C + P. Child dental trait anxiety and child dental state anxiety, measured at every treatment visit, showed no evidence of any statistically or clinically significant difference between arms in adjusted mean scores averaged over all follow-up visits.
CONCLUSIONS


The differences noted in COHRQOL and child-based dental trait and dental state anxiety measures across three treatment strategies for managing dental caries in primary teeth were small, and not considered to be clinically meaningful. The findings highlight the importance of including all three strategies in a clinician's armamentarium, to manage childhood caries throughout the young child's life and achieve positive experiences of dental care.",2020,"There was no evidence of a difference in the estimated adjusted mean P-CPQ-16 at the final visit which was, on average, 0.3 points higher (97.5% CI: -1.1 to 1.6) in B + P than C + P and 0.2 points higher, on average, (97.5% CI: -1.2 to 1.5) in PA than for C + P.

102,32340334,Temperamental Development among Preterm Born Children. An RCT Follow-Up Study.,"A randomized controlled trial study recruited 146 preterm born children, either to participate in a modified version of the Mother-Infant Transaction Program (MITP-m) or to receive the usual follow-up services, before and after discharge from a neonatal intensive care unit. This follow-up study investigates whether MITP participation is associated with parental perceptions of child temperament from two to seven years. Children's temperament was reported by mothers and fathers separately at children's ages of 2, 3, 5, and 7 years. Parents in the MITP-m group reported lower levels of negative emotionality in their children compared to the control group. In maternal reports, a group effect (F(1, 121) = 9.7,  p  = 0.002) revealed a stable difference in children's negative emotionality from two to seven years, while a group-by-time interaction related to an increasing difference was detected in reports from fathers (F(1, 94) = 4.8,  p  = 0.03). Another group difference appeared in fathers' reports of children's soothability (F(1, 100) = 14.2,  p  < 0.0005).

104,32340367,Evaluation of the French National Program on Home Return of Patients with Chronic Heart Failure (PRADO-IC): Pilot Study of 91 Patients During Its Deployment in the Bas Rhin Area.,"OBJECTIVE


The main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the French national program on home return of chronic heart failure patients (PRADO-IC) in terms of re-hospitalizations for heart failure (HF) during its deployment in the Bas-Rhin (France).
PATIENTS AND METHODS


This was a pilot, descriptive, quantitative, retrospective, and bi-centric study (University Hospitals of Strasbourg and Haguenau Hospital Center, France). It included all patients included in the PRADO-IC program from these centers between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015. The primary endpoint of our study was the evaluation of the number of 1-year, 6-month, and 30-day re-admissions to the hospital in relation to an acute HF episode, before and after the inclusion of patients in the PRADO-IC program. The secondary endpoints were the number of overall re-hospitalizations (all-cause); the number of days of hospitalization for HF; the time to first re-hospitalization and the average length of hospital stay, before and after inclusion in PRADO-IC; and the overall and cardiovascular mortality rates.
RESULTS


91 patients out of 271 (33,6%) with a mean age of 79.2 years (67-94) were included. They all had chronic HF, essentially class II-III NYHA (90.1%), mostly of ischemic origin (41.9%), with altered left ventricular ejection fraction in 71.4% of cases. A reduction in the mean number of hospitalizations for HF per patient at 30 days, 6 months and 1 year was observed, respectively, from 0.18 ± 0.42 per patient before inclusion to 0.15 ± 0.36 after inclusion (p = 0.56); 0.98 ± 1.04 hospitalizations to 0.53 ± 0.81 at 6 months (p < 0.01); and 1.64 ± 1.14 hospitalizations 1.04 ± 1.05 at 1 year (p < 0.001). Patients were hospitalized less overall after inclusion in the PRADO-IC program. The number of days of hospitalization for HF was reduced after inclusion of patients from 18.02 ± 7.78 days before inclusion to 14.28 ± 11.57 days for the 6 month follow-up (p = 0.006), and from 22.07 ± 10.33 days before inclusion to 16.39 ± 15.94 days for the 1 year follow-up (p < 0.001). In contrast, inclusion in PRADO-IC statistically increased the mean time to first re-hospitalization for HF from mean 99.36 ± 72.39 days before inclusion to 148.11 ± 112.77 days after inclusion (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION


This study seems to demonstrate that the PRADO-IC program could improve the management of chronic HF patients in ambulatory care, particularly regarding HF re-hospitalization. However, due to the limitations of the methodology used and the small number of patients, it is advisable to consolidate its initial results with a randomized controlled study on a larger number of patients.

105,32340375,Effect of Increased Daily Water Intake and Hydration on Health in Japanese Adults.,"Increased hydration is recommended as healthy habit with several merits. However, supportive data are sparse. To assess the efficacy of increased daily water intake, we tested the effect of water supplementation on biomarkers in blood, urine, and saliva. Twenty-four healthy Japanese men and 31 healthy Japanese women with fasting blood glucose levels ranging from 90-125 mg/dL were included. An open-label, two-arm, randomized controlled trial was conducted for 12 weeks. Two additional 550 mL bottles of water on top of habitual fluid intake were consumed in the intervention group. The subjects drank one bottle of water (550 mL) within 2 h of waking, and one bottle (550 mL) 2 h before bedtime. Subjects increased mean fluid intake from 1.3 L/day to 2.0 L/day, without changes in total energy intake. Total body water rate increased with associated water supplementation. There were no significant changes in fasting blood glucose and arginine vasopressin levels, but systolic blood pressure was significantly decreased in the intervention group. Furthermore, water supplementation increased body temperature, reduced blood urea nitrogen concentration, and suppressed estimated glomerular filtration rate reduction. Additionally, existence of an intestinal microbiome correlated with decreased systolic blood pressure and increased body temperature. Habitual water supplementation after waking up and before bedtime in healthy subjects with slightly elevated fasting blood glucose levels is not effective in lowering these levels. However, it represents a safe and promising intervention with the potential for lowering blood pressure, increasing body temperature, diluting blood waste materials, and protecting kidney function. Thus, increasing daily water intake could provide several health benefits.",2020,"There were no significant changes in fasting blood glucose and arginine vasopressin levels, but systolic blood pressure was significantly decreased in the intervention group.","['healthy subjects', 'Twenty-four healthy Japanese men and 31 healthy Japanese women with fasting blood glucose levels ranging from 90-125 mg/dL were included', 'Japanese Adults']","['Habitual water supplementation', 'Increased Daily Water Intake and Hydration', 'water supplementation']","['mean fluid intake', 'biomarkers in blood, urine, and saliva', 'body temperature, reduced blood urea nitrogen concentration', 'total energy intake', 'systolic blood pressure and increased body temperature', 'Total body water rate', 'systolic blood pressure', 'glomerular filtration rate reduction', 'fasting blood glucose and arginine vasopressin levels']","[{'cui': 'C1708335', 'cui_str': 'Healthy Participants'}, {'cui': 'C3715070', 'cui_str': '24'}, {'cui': 'C0376247', 'cui_str': 'Japanese language'}, {'cui': 'C0025266', 'cui_str': 'Man'}, {'cui': 'C0043210', 'cui_str': 'Woman'}, {'cui': 'C0428568', 'cui_str': 'Fasting blood glucose measurement'}, {'cui': 'C3542016', 'cui_str': 'Concept model range'}, {'cui': 'C4319551', 'cui_str': '125'}, {'cui': 'C0439269', 'cui_str': 'mg/dL'}, {'cui': 'C0332257', 'cui_str': 'Including'}, {'cui': 'C0001675', 'cui_str': 'Adult'}]","[{'cui': 'C0205353', 'cui_str': 'Habitual'}, {'cui': 'C0020311', 'cui_str': 'Hydrotherapy'}, {'cui': 'C0242297', 'cui_str': 'Nutritional supplementation'}, {'cui': 'C0205217', 'cui_str': 'Increased'}, {'cui': 'C0332173', 'cui_str': 'Daily'}, {'cui': 'C0013123', 'cui_str': 'Water intake'}, {'cui': 'C1321013', 'cui_str': 'Hydration status'}]","[{'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0429791', 'cui_str': 'Fluid intake'}, {'cui': 'C0005516', 'cui_str': 'Biological Markers'}, {'cui': 'C0005767', 'cui_str': 'Blood'}, {'cui': 'C0042036', 'cui_str': 'Urine'}, {'cui': 'C0036087', 'cui_str': 'Saliva'}, {'cui': 'C0005903', 'cui_str': 'Body temperature'}, {'cui': 'C0005845', 'cui_str': 'Blood urea nitrogen measurement'}, {'cui': 'C0004268', 'cui_str': 'Attention'}, {'cui': 'C0439810', 'cui_str': 'Total'}, {'cui': 'C0006777', 'cui_str': 'Energy intake'}, {'cui': 'C0871470', 'cui_str': 'Systolic blood pressure'}, {'cui': 'C0015967', 'cui_str': 'Fever'}, {'cui': 'C0412472', 'cui_str': 'Total body water measurement'}, {'cui': 'C0017654', 'cui_str': 'Glomerular filtration rate'}, {'cui': 'C0301630', 'cui_str': 'Reduction (chemical)'}, {'cui': 'C0428568', 'cui_str': 'Fasting blood glucose measurement'}, {'cui': 'C0003779', 'cui_str': 'Argipressin'}, {'cui': 'C0441889', 'cui_str': 'Levels'}]",24.0,0.0273587,"There were no significant changes in fasting blood glucose and arginine vasopressin levels, but systolic blood pressure was significantly decreased in the intervention group.","[{'ForeName': 'Yumi', 'Initials': 'Y', 'LastName': 'Nakamura', 'Affiliation': 'Suntory Global Innovation Center Ltd.

106,32340597,Impact of Behavioral Health Homes on Cost and Utilization Outcomes.,"OBJECTIVE


This study evaluated the impact of two behavioral health home (BHH) approaches, provider-supported care and self-directed care, on health care utilization and cost outcomes among adult Medicaid recipients with serious mental illness.
METHODS


Eleven community mental health provider sites were randomly assigned to one of the BHH approaches, which each site implemented over a 2-year period. In both approaches, staff were trained in wellness coaching to support patients' progress toward general health and wellness goals. Provider-supported sites employed a full-time on-site registered nurse, who provided consultation to patients and wellness coaches. Each approach had a consistently enrolled treatment group (combined N=859) with a matched comparison cohort that was identified for analysis. Approaches were compared with each other and with baseline, and differences between each approach and its comparison cohort were examined by using analysis of covariance to determine impact on total health care cost, prescription costs, and use and cost of general medical and behavioral health services.
RESULTS


Relative to its comparison cohort, each approach achieved significant reductions in total cost (15% for provider-supported care and 26% for self-directed care) and increases in use of outpatient general medical services (43% for provider-supported care and 29% for self-directed care). Compared with self-directed care, provider-supported care resulted in approximately 28% lower use of general medical inpatient services and 26% lower related costs.

107,32340616,Feasibility and acceptability of an innovative adherence intervention for young adults with childhood-onset systemic Lupus Erythematosus.,"BACKGROUND


In Childhood-Onset Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (cSLE), poor medication adherence rates are very high. Interventions targeting this problem in cSLE are limited thus effective interventions are needed. The objective of this study is to examine the feasibility and acceptability an intervention (automated digital reminders + personalized prescribed treatment plan (pPTP)) to improve medication adherence in young adults with cSLE over 3 months.
METHOD


This is a proof-of-concept randomized controlled study. All participants received SimpleMed+ pillboxes that track adherence. The treatment group received a pPTP, and in month 2, preselected digital reminders for missed doses. Reminders were discontinued after 30 days and adherence data collected. Data analysis was done using t-tests.
RESULTS


Twenty-one participants were approached and nineteen consented to participate, yielding a recruitment rate of 86%. Participants were on average 20.5 years, mostly black (58%) and female (84%). Of the nineteen consented, eleven were randomized to control (57%) and eight to treatment (42%) groups respectively. All participants in the treatment group rated the pillbox as easy to use, notably; none reported boredom with the pillbox or reminders. Also, 88% of participants in the treatment group rated the pillbox as helpful, however, only 50% reported the pPTP taught them new information about lupus or made them more interested in their lupus management.
CONCLUSIONS


This is the first use of an electronic pillbox to track adherence to multiple medications in cSLE. The high rating of the pillbox makes it an acceptable method of measuring adherence. Feasibility and acceptability ratings for the intervention were mixed suggesting a there is a subset of cSLE patients for whom this intervention would be beneficial.

108,32340632,Acute effects of cannabis on speech illusions and psychotic-like symptoms: two studies testing the moderating effects of cannabidiol and adolescence.,"BACKGROUND


Acute cannabis administration can produce transient psychotic-like effects in healthy individuals. However, the mechanisms through which this occurs and which factors predict vulnerability remain unclear. We investigate whether cannabis inhalation leads to psychotic-like symptoms and speech illusion; and whether cannabidiol (CBD) blunts such effects (study 1) and adolescence heightens such effects (study 2).
METHODS


Two double-blind placebo-controlled studies, assessing speech illusion in a white noise task, and psychotic-like symptoms on the Psychotomimetic States Inventory (PSI). Study 1 compared effects of Cann-CBD (cannabis containing Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and negligible levels of CBD) with Cann+CBD (cannabis containing THC and CBD) in 17 adults. Study 2 compared effects of Cann-CBD in 20 adolescents and 20 adults. All participants were healthy individuals who currently used cannabis.
RESULTS


In study 1, relative to placebo, both Cann-CBD and Cann+CBD increased PSI scores but not speech illusion. No differences between Cann-CBD and Cann+CBD emerged. In study 2, relative to placebo, Cann-CBD increased PSI scores and incidence of speech illusion, with the odds of experiencing speech illusion 3.1 (95% CIs 1.3-7.2) times higher after Cann-CBD. No age group differences were found for speech illusion, but adults showed heightened effects on the PSI.
CONCLUSIONS

109,31711093,Using compositional principal component analysis to describe children's gut microbiota in relation to diet and body composition.,"BACKGROUND


Gut microbiota data obtained by DNA sequencing are complex and compositional because of large numbers of detectable taxa, and because microbiota characteristics are described in relative terms. Nutrition researchers use principal component analysis (PCA) to derive dietary patterns from food data. Although compositional PCA methods are not commonly used to describe patterns from complex microbiota data, this approach would be useful for identifying gut microbiota patterns associated with diet and body composition.
OBJECTIVES


To use compositional PCA to describe the principal components (PCs) of gut microbiota in 5-y-old children and explore associations between microbiota components, diet, and BMI z-score.
METHODS


A fecal sample was provided by 319 children aged 5 y. Their primary caregiver completed a validated 123-item quantitative FFQ. Body composition was determined using DXA, and a BMI z-score was calculated. Compositional PCA identified characterizing taxa and weightings for calculation of gut microbiota PC scores at the genus level, and was examined in relation to diet and body size.
RESULTS


Three gut microbiota PCs were found. PC1 (negative loadings on uncultured Christensenellaceae and Ruminococcaceae) was related to lower BMI z-scores and longer duration of breastfeeding (per month) (β = -0.14; 95% CI: -0.26, -0.02; and β = 0.02; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.34, respectively). PC2 (positive loadings on Fusicatenibacter and Bifidobacterium; negative loadings on Bacteroides) was associated with a lower intake of nuts, seeds, and legumes (β = -0.05 per gram; 95% CI: -0.09, -0.01). When adjusted for fiber intake, PC2 was also associated with higher BMI z-scores (β = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.24). PC3 (positive loadings on Faecalibacterium, Eubacterium, and Roseburia) was associated with higher intakes of fiber (β = 0.02 per gram; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.04) and total nonstarch polysaccharides (β = 0.02 per gram; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.04).

110,32366994,Promoting healthy lifestyle in Chinese college students: evaluation of a social media-based intervention applying the RE-AIM framework.,"BACKGROUND


A health program aiming at college students is pressingly needed to improve their lifestyle and prevent diseases. However, a health intervention often requires health facilities and the many efforts of health workers. This project attempts to evolve traditional health intervention by using integrated methods based on social media and multiple mobile tools.
METHODS


A total of 110 undergraduates from Zhejiang University were recruited. In all, 87 participants volunteered to enroll in the intervention group, whereas 23 stayed in a control group. Fifteen staff (dietitians, health assistants and a sports coach) used the WeChat app and its plugin Zhishi mini-program for health education, diet and physical activity (PA) supervision during 21 days. Pre-to-post changes of eating habits, physical fitness tests and anthropometry data were measured. The RE-AIM framework was employed to evaluate the intervention, dimensions of which were Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance.
RESULTS


The recruitment rate of students was 79.1%. The intervention group showed significant progress in terms of healthy food intake (all P < 0.05), and an improvement in PA level (P = 0.004) over 21 days. About 60.9% subjects were satisfied with the whole program and 64.4% would like to join the program again.

111,32366996,One week of levofloxacin plus dexamethasone eye drops for cataract surgery: an innovative and rational therapeutic strategy.,"BACKGROUND


Cataract surgery is the most common operation performed worldwide. A fixed topical corticosteroid-antibiotic combination is usually prescribed in clinical practice for 2 or more weeks to treat post surgical inflammation and prevent infection. However, this protracted schedule may increase the incidence of corticosteroid-related adverse events and notably promote antibiotic resistance.
METHODS


This International, multicentre, randomized, blinded-assessor, parallel-group clinical study evaluated the non-inferiority of 1-week levofloxacin/dexamethasone eye drops, followed by 1-week dexamethasone alone, vs. 2-week gold-standard tobramycin/dexamethasone (one drop QID for all schedules) to prevent and treat ocular inflammation and prevent infection after uncomplicated cataract surgery. Non-inferiority was defined as the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) around a treatment difference >-10%. The study randomized 808 patients enrolled in 53 centres (Italy, Germany, Spain and Russia). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients without anterior chamber inflammation on day 15 defined as the end of treatment. Endophthalmitis was the key secondary endpoint. This study is registered with EudraCT code: 2018-000286-36.
RESULTS


After the end of treatment, 95.2% of the patients in the test arm vs. 94.9% of the control arm had no signs of inflammation in the anterior chamber (difference between proportions of patients = 0.028; 95% CI: -0.0275/0.0331). No case of endophthalmitis was reported. No statistically significant difference was evident in any of the other secondary endpoints. Both treatments were well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS


Non-inferiority of the new short pharmacological strategy was proven.

113,32346965,"Does deep sedation with analgesia have positive effects on anxiety, pain and compliance in patients before and after prostate biopsy?","AIMS


To investigate whether deep sedation for transrectal prostate biopsy could reduce anxiety and pain and enhance rebiopsy compliance.
METHODS


A two-centre prospective observation study was conducted under two different anaesthetic conditions: deep sedation with analgesia and local anaesthesia with lidocaine. A 12-core prostate biopsy was taken in all patients. Scores on a 0-10 visual analogue scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-X-1, the Beck Anxiety Inventory and a five-level Likert satisfaction scale were evaluated. Finally, all patients were asked about their willingness to undergo the same procedure again if necessary and whether they wanted to change the anaesthetic method (deep sedation to local anaesthesia or local to sedation) if a repeat procedure was required.
RESULTS


A total of 135 patients were included in this study, including 69 patients in the sedation group and 66 patients in the local group. Lower pain scores (P < .001) and higher satisfaction scores (P = .019) were observed in the sedation group than in the local group after the procedure. Anxiety scores in the sedation group were significantly decreased after the procedure, whereas those were not changed in the local group. The question regarding rebiopsy compliance tended to be more positive in the sedation than in the local group (73.9% vs 62.1%, respectively, P = .099). The proportion of patients who wanted to change their anaesthetic method was much higher in the local than in the sedation group (68.2% vs 11.6%, respectively, P < .001).

114,32346981,Predicting bone and soft tissue alterations of immediate implant sites in the esthetic zone using clinical parameters.,"BACKGROUND


Immediate implantation is generally a predictable treatment, but sometimes there are significant tissue alterations at the surgical site which compromise clinical outcomes.
PURPOSE


This study aimed to investigate the association between tissue alterations and different clinical parameters in esthetic areas following immediate implant placement and provisionalization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS


Clinical parameters were measured at 36 non-grafted immediate implant sites enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. Alterations of bone and soft tissue were measured at 12 months after the treatment. Stepwise linear regression analysis was performed to analyze the association between different clinical parameters and outcomes of interest.
RESULTS


Gingival thickness 3 mm apical to the gingival margin (GT3) was positively associated with recession of mid-buccal gingival margin, while vertical distance between the buccal gingival margin and the crest (GM-bone) was negatively associated (P = .03, .01). Flap elevation and older age were positively associated with recession of the interproximal gingival margin (P = .04, .01). Horizontal defect dimension was positively associated with buccal ridge dimensional reduction while gingival thickness at free gingival margin (GT1) was negatively associated (P = .01, .04). Regarding interproximal bone level change, none of the clinical parameters was significantly associated.
CONCLUSIONS


Gingival phenotype was the only parameter significantly associated with both buccal gingival recession and buccal ridge dimensional reduction. It is important to assess clinical parameters before and during immediate implant procedure.",2020,"Flap elevation and older age were positively associated with recession of the interproximal gingival margin (P = .04, .01).",['Clinical parameters were measured at 36 non-grafted immediate implant sites enrolled in a randomized controlled trial'],['immediate implant placement and provisionalization'],"['Gingival thickness 3\u2009mm apical to the gingival margin (GT3', 'buccal gingival recession and buccal ridge dimensional reduction', 'Gingival phenotype', 'Flap elevation and older age', 'Alterations of bone and soft tissue', 'buccal ridge dimensional reduction while gingival thickness at free gingival margin (GT1']","[{'cui': 'C0205210', 'cui_str': 'Clinical'}, {'cui': 'C0449381', 'cui_str': 'Observation parameter'}, {'cui': 'C0079809', 'cui_str': 'Measure'}, {'cui': 'C0181074', 'cui_str': 'Graft material'}, {'cui': 'C0205253', 'cui_str': 'Immediate'}, {'cui': 'C0021102', 'cui_str': 'Implant'}, {'cui': 'C0205145', 'cui_str': 'Site'}, {'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}, {'cui': 'C0008976', 'cui_str': 'Clinical trial'}]","[{'cui': 'C0205253', 'cui_str': 'Immediate'}, {'cui': 'C0021102', 'cui_str': 'Implant'}, {'cui': 'C0021107', 'cui_str': 'Implantation procedure'}]","[{'cui': 'C0017562', 'cui_str': 'Gingival structure'}, {'cui': 'C1280412', 'cui_str': 'Thick'}, {'cui': 'C0205111', 'cui_str': 'Apical'}, {'cui': 'C0205284', 'cui_str': 'Marginal'}, {'cui': 'C0442010', 'cui_str': 'Buccal'}, {'cui': 'C0017572', 'cui_str': 'Gingival recession'}, {'cui': 'C0332243', 'cui_str': 'Ridging'}, {'cui': 'C0301630', 'cui_str': 'Reduction (chemical)'}, {'cui': 'C0031437', 'cui_str': 'Phenotype'}, {'cui': 'C0038925', 'cui_str': 'Flap'}, {'cui': 'C0439775', 'cui_str': 'Elevation'}, {'cui': 'C0231337', 'cui_str': 'Senility'}, {'cui': 'C0262950', 'cui_str': 'Bone structure'}, {'cui': 'C0225317', 'cui_str': 'Soft tissue'}, {'cui': 'C0332296', 'cui_str': 'Free of'}]",36.0,0.0323287,"Flap elevation and older age were positively associated with recession of the interproximal gingival margin (P = .04, .01).","[{'ForeName': 'Chun-Teh', 'Initials': 'CT', 'LastName': 'Lee', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Periodontics and Dental Hygiene, The University of Texas Health Science Center School of Dentistry, Houston, Texas, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Elena', 'Initials': 'E', 'LastName': 'Sanz-Miralles', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Periodontics, Section of Oral and Diagnostic Sciences, Columbia University College of Dental Medicine, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Liang', 'Initials': 'L', 'LastName': 'Zhu', 'Affiliation': 'Biostatistics & Epidemiology Research Design Core, Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jaclyn', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Glick', 'Affiliation': 'Private practice, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'ForeName': 'Andrew', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Heath', 'Affiliation': ""Department of Pediatric and Special Needs Dentistry, Arkansas Children's Hospital, Little Rock, Arkansas, USA.""}, {'ForeName': 'Janet', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Stoupel', 'Affiliation': 'Private practice, New York, New York, USA.'}]",Clinical implant dentistry and related research,['10.1111/cid.12910']
115,32347005,Combined Application of Dexamethasone and Tranexamic Acid to Reduce the Postoperative Inflammatory Response and Improve Functional Outcomes in Total Hip Arthroplasty.,"OBJECTIVE


To evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined use of tranexamic acid (TXA) and dexamethasone (DEX) for anti-inflammatory and clinical outcomes after total hip arthroplasty (THA).
METHODS


A total of 100 patients were included in this randomized, controlled study. Patients in the TXA + DEX group were administered TXA at a dose of 15 mg/kg, which was repeated 3 h after THA, and received 20 mg DEX. In contrast, patients in the TXA group were administered TXA at a dose of 15 mg/kg, which was repeated at 3 h postoperatively. C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and pain levels, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), total blood loss and transfusion rates, postoperative fatigue, range of motion (ROM), length of hospital stay (LOS), analgesic rescue and antiemetic rescue consumption, and complications were compared in both groups.
RESULTS


The CRP and IL-6 levels were lower in the TXA + DEX group than in the TXA group (all P < 0.001) at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h postoperatively. Patients in the TXA + DEX group had lower pain scores at rest and walking at 24 h postoperatively (all P < 0.001). In the TXA + DEX group, the incidence of PONV was lower (P = 0.005), postoperative fatigue (P < 0.001) was reduced, and analgesia and antiemetic rescue consumption were also reduced. The total blood loss, transfusion rate, LOS and hip ROM were similar in the two groups. There was no thrombosis, infection, or gastrointestinal bleeding in either group.
CONCLUSION


Compared to TXA alone, the combination of TXA + DEX can reduce postoperative inflammatory response, relieve pain, and reduce PONV and fatigue, without increasing the risk of complications. Therefore, the present study suggested that the combination of TXA + DEX is an effective and safe accelerated rehabilitation strategy for patients receiving primary unilateral THA.",2020,Patients in the TXA + DEX group had lower pain scores at rest and walking at 24 h postoperatively (all P < 0.001).,"['Total Hip Arthroplasty', 'total hip arthroplasty (THA', 'A total of 100 patients', 'patients receiving primary unilateral THA']","['20\u2009mg DEX', 'tranexamic acid (TXA) and dexamethasone (DEX', 'TXA', 'Dexamethasone and Tranexamic Acid', 'TXA\u2009+\u2009DEX']","['pain scores', 'postoperative inflammatory response, relieve pain, and reduce PONV and fatigue', 'Postoperative Inflammatory Response', 'postoperative fatigue', 'total blood loss, transfusion rate, LOS and hip ROM', 'efficacy and safety', 'incidence of PONV', 'analgesia and antiemetic rescue consumption', 'C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and pain levels, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), total blood loss and transfusion rates, postoperative fatigue, range of motion (ROM), length of hospital stay (LOS), analgesic rescue and antiemetic rescue consumption, and complications', 'CRP and IL-6 levels', 'thrombosis, infection, or gastrointestinal bleeding']","[{'cui': 'C0040508', 'cui_str': 'Total replacement of hip'}, {'cui': 'C0439810', 'cui_str': 'Total'}, {'cui': 'C1704407', 'cui_str': '100'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0205225', 'cui_str': 'Principal'}, {'cui': 'C0205092', 'cui_str': 'Unilateral'}]","[{'cui': 'C0011777', 'cui_str': 'Dexamethasone'}, {'cui': 'C0040613', 'cui_str': 'Tranexamic Acid'}]","[{'cui': 'C0582148', 'cui_str': 'Pain score'}, {'cui': 'C0032790', 'cui_str': 'Postoperative period'}, {'cui': 'C0002766', 'cui_str': 'Pain management'}, {'cui': 'C0392756', 'cui_str': 'Reduced'}, {'cui': 'C0520909', 'cui_str': 'Postoperative nausea and vomiting'}, {'cui': 'C0015672', 'cui_str': 'Fatigue'}, {'cui': 'C0232100', 'cui_str': 'Exsanguination'}, {'cui': 'C0005841', 'cui_str': 'Transfusion of blood product'}, {'cui': 'C0023303', 'cui_str': 'Length of Stay'}, {'cui': 'C0576002', 'cui_str': 'Hip joint - range of movement'}, {'cui': 'C1280519', 'cui_str': 'Effectiveness'}, {'cui': 'C0036043', 'cui_str': 'Safety'}, {'cui': 'C0021149', 'cui_str': 'Incidence'}, {'cui': 'C0003297', 'cui_str': 'Antiemetic agent'}, {'cui': 'C0009830', 'cui_str': 'Consumption'}, {'cui': 'C0006560', 'cui_str': 'C reactive protein'}, {'cui': 'C0021760', 'cui_str': 'Interleukin-6'}, {'cui': 'C0518087', 'cui_str': 'Pain level'}, {'cui': 'C0080078', 'cui_str': 'Range of joint movement'}, {'cui': 'C0002771', 'cui_str': 'Analgesic'}, {'cui': 'C0009566', 'cui_str': 'Complication'}, {'cui': 'C0441889', 'cui_str': 'Levels'}, {'cui': 'C0040053', 'cui_str': 'Thrombosis'}, {'cui': 'C0009450', 'cui_str': 'Communicable disease'}, {'cui': 'C0017181', 'cui_str': 'Gastrointestinal hemorrhage'}]",100.0,0.0883103,Patients in the TXA + DEX group had lower pain scores at rest and walking at 24 h postoperatively (all P < 0.001).,"[{'ForeName': 'Yu-Zhang', 'Initials': 'YZ', 'LastName': 'An', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 401120, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Ming-Deng', 'Initials': 'MD', 'LastName': 'Xu', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 401120, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Yu-Cheng', 'Initials': 'YC', 'LastName': 'An', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 401120, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Huan', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Liu', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Surgical Inpatient, Cai Jia Hospital, Chongqing, 401120, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Ming', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Zheng', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 401120, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Dian-Ming', 'Initials': 'DM', 'LastName': 'Jiang', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, 401120, China.'}]",Orthopaedic surgery,['10.1111/os.12664']
116,32347137,Study of cervical precancerous lesions detection by spectroscopy and support vector machine.,"Background and objective:  Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) offers a fast, non-invasive, and low-cost alternative for cervical cancer diagnosis. We aim to develop a method for screening precancerous lesions based on DRS. Material and methods:  Characteristic parameters of cervical tissue were extracted from spectra, including optical characteristic parameters such as absorption and scattering coefficients, and some slope and area parameters of the spectrum. Data were randomly divided into training (60%) and test (40%) sets. Of the 210 included patients, 166 were healthy, 22 had erosion of the cervix, and 31 had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used to classify normal and abnormal cervical tissue based on 11 characteristic parameters. Results:  The SVM with linear kernel function, applied on the training data, could distinguish tissue with lesions from healthy tissue with an accuracy of 1.00. When the classifiers were applied to the test set, erosion of cervix and CIN could be discriminated from healthy tissue with an accuracy of 0.95 ([Formula: see text]0.03). Conclusions:  This research shows that the diagnostic algorithm can be valuable for non-invasive diagnosis of cervical cancer.

Methods:  From January 2016 to December 2017, 80 elderly patients with severe VAP who were hospitalized in Zhejiang Hospital were divided into acetylcysteine+ bronchoscopy group [24 males and 16 females, aged (78±7) years] and bronchoscopy group [26 males and 14 females, aged (80±7) years]using random number table for a prospective cohort study. Patients in bronchoscopy group were treated with bronchoscopy in addition to conventional supportive care of symptoms. Patients in acetylcysteine+ bronchoscopy group received nebulized acetylcysteine inhalation therapy on the basis of the treatment given to patients in bronchoscopy group. Patients in both groups received treatment continuously for 7 days. The simplified clinical pulmonary infection score (CPIS) in both groups was assessed before and after treatment. Venous blood of 10 mL was collected before and after treatment to detect leukocyte count, serum C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin. Arterial blood of 1 mL was collected before and after treatment to detect partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO(2)), partial arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO(2)), oxygenation index. The inhalation platform pressure (Pplat), dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn), airway resistance, work of breathing, time of antibiotic use, and time of mechanical ventilation of patients in two groups were recorded before and after treatment. Data were statistically analyzed with chi-square test and  t  test.  Results:  (1) The simplified CPIS, leukocyte count, serum C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin of patients in acetylcysteine+ bronchoscopy group were significantly lower than those in bronchoscopy group after treatment ( t =2.32, 2.15, 6.08, 7.12,  P <0.05 or  P <0.01). The simplified CPIS, leukocyte count, serum C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin of patients in acetylcysteine+ bronchoscopy group and bronchoscopy group after treatment were significantly lower than those before treatment ( t =13.76, 13.60, 12.70, 8.32, 11.44, 14.28, 9.48, 9.50,  P <0.01). (2) Compared with bronchoscopy group, patients in acetylcysteine+ bronchoscopy group had significantly higher PaO(2) and oxygenation index ( t =4.14, 2.55,  P <0.05 or  P <0.01) but significantly lower PaCO(2) ( t =4.36,  P <0.01) after treatment. The PaO(2) and oxygenation index of patients in acetylcysteine+ bronchoscopy group after treatment were significantly higher than those before treatment ( t =10.90, 43.72,  P <0.01). The PaO(2) and oxygenation index of patients in bronchoscopy group after treatment were also significantly higher than those before treatment ( t =6.55, 43.03,  P <0.01). The PaCO(2) of patients in both groups after treatment were significantly lower than those before treatment ( t =21.54, 21.92,  P <0.01). (3) The Cdyn of patients in acetylcysteine+ bronchoscopy group after treatment was significantly higher than that in bronchoscopy group ( t =5.41,  P <0.01), and Pplat, airway resistance, and work of breathing were significantly lower than those in bronchoscopy group ( t =2.18, 5.46, 2.49,  P <0.05 or  P <0.01).

119,32340417,[Clinical effectiveness of super pulsed carbon dioxide fractional laser debridement surgery in treating chronic wounds].,"Objective:  To investigate the clinical effectiveness of super pulsed carbon dioxide fractional laser debridement surgery on the treatment of chronic wounds.  Methods:  From December 2018 to May 2019, 37 patients with chronic wounds who met the inclusion criteria were admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University for a prospective randomized controlled study. Using the random number table, the patients were divided into surgical debridement group (19 patients, 4 males and 15 females, aged (58±16) years, 25 wounds) and laser debridement group (18 patients, 9 males and 9 females, aged (58±10) years, 23 wounds). In patients of surgical debridement group, oedematous and aging granulation tissue was scraped from the wound by scalpel handle or curet, and the residual necrotic tissue was removed by sharp surgical instruments. In patients of laser debridement group, oedematous and aging granulation tissue and necrotic tissue was removed by super pulsed carbon dioxide fractional laser therapeutic machine, laser gasification debridement was performed repeatedly till fresh normal tissue layer observed. In patients of the two groups, according to the wound in the first 3 d after the first debridement, debridement dressing was performed twice at least as before, then wound debridement dressing was performed once every 1 to 4 days as before according to the wound conditions. The wound healing rates on 7, 14, 21, and 28 d after the first debridement were calculated. The positive rates of bacterial culture of wounds before and after the first debridement were calculated. The color and texture of the wound granulation tissue before the first debridement and on 7, 14, and 28 d after the first debridement were observed and scored. The pain scores before every debridement, during every debridement, and after every debridement dressing change were evaluated by visual analogue scale. The times of debridement dressing change were recorded. Data were statistically analyzed with two independent sample  t  test, analysis of variance for repeated measurement, Fisher's exact probability test, Mann-Whitney  U  test, and Bonferroni correction.  Results:  (1) On 7, 14, 21, and 28 d after the first debridement, the wound healing rates of patients in laser debridement group (29.5% (24.1%, 36.0%), 47.1% (42.7%, 62.4%), 71.4% (62.2%, 76.8%), and 88.6% (79.2%, 96.3%) were significantly higher than those of surgical debridement group (1.6% (1.0%, 12.8%), 12.7% (2.0%, 16.6%), 24.5% (8.9%, 45.5%), 43.9% (23.2%, 70.8%),  Z =3.477, 3.553, 2.721, 2.193,  P <0.05 or  P <0.01). (2) Before the first debridement, the positive rates of bacterial culture of wounds in patients of laser debridement group and surgical debridement group were 92% (23/25) and 91% (21/23), respectively, which were similar ( P >0.05). After the first debridement, the positive rate of bacterial culture of wounds of patients in surgical debridement group was 64% (16/25), which was significantly higher than 13% (3/23) of laser debridement group ( P <0.01). (3) On 7, 14, and 28 d after the first debridement, the scores of color and texture of wound granulation tissue of patients in laser debridement group were significantly higher than those of surgical debridement group ( Z =3.420, 5.682, 6.142, 4.461, 5.337, 4.458,  P <0.01). (4) The pain scores during every debridement and after every debridement dressing change in patients of laser debridement group were significantly lower than those of surgical debridement group ( t =2.847, 5.046,  P <0.05 or  P <0.01). (5) The time of debridement dressing change in laser debridement group was 8.0 (7.0, 10.0) times, which was significantly less than 10.0 (9.5, 12.5) times in surgical debridement group ( Z =2.261,  P <0.05).  Conclusions:  Compared with traditional surgical debridement method, super pulsed carbon dioxide fractional laser debridement surgery is more effective in treating patients with chronic wounds.

Methods:  A total of 118 junior nurses starting to work in the First Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Medical University from July 2017 to July 2018 met the inclusion criteria and were divided into routine training (RT) group and scenario infiltration joint interactive training (SIJIT) group using the random number table for prospective randomized controlled trial. There were 2 males and 57 females, aged (23.9±1.2) years in RT group and 3 males and 56 females, aged (23.5±1.3) years in SIJIT group. Before the training, nurses in both groups received theory and practical tests for the prevention and treatment of pressure sore with a homemade theory test paper and operation requirements designed by the training group. The training content was drawn up in 3 themes according to the weak points shown in the test. Nurses in RT group were trained in a large classroom with the help of multimedia teaching technique, and one lesson of 2 h targeting one theme was given once a week.Nurses in SIJIT group were trained by using the SIJIT mode, with online self-study for 2 weeks and then multimedia theory and practical teaching, and interaction in scene. After the training, theoretical and practical tests were conducted again in nurses of two groups. Satisfaction scores of nurses for the training mode, training effect, and curriculum design and answers to open questions about the degree of training satisfaction were investigated through homemade questionnaire for satisfaction degree. Homemade training contents and requirements questionnaire designed by the training group was used to understand the demands of nurses for training contents and requirements in 2 groups. Data were statistically analyzed with chi-square test and independent sample  t  test.  Results:  (1) The theoretical and practical scores on the prevention and treatment of pressure sore before the training were (78±11) and (83±10) points respectively in RT group, similar to (79±11) and (84±10) points in SIJIT group ( t =0.522, 0.615,  P >0.05).

121,32340479,Visual Juxtapositions as Exemplars in Messages Promoting Healthy Dietary Behavior.,"While health communicators often study strategic health messages, investigations of how visual message elements complement or inhibit persuasive efforts are sparse in the literature. Visual juxtapositions, which refer to one visual presentation featuring two images placed next to each other, are one such visual element. In the context of improving public communication efforts related to promoting healthy dietary choices, we use visual persuasion theory and exemplification theory to test whether different visual juxtapositions influence message recipients' expectations to share message content and reduce their consumption of unhealthy products (i.e., sugary drinks and salty foods). We carried out two studies, each a two-wave, longitudinal randomized experiment, to test for direct effects and assess the potential for indirect or delayed associations of visual persuasion appeals using visual juxtapositions. We consistently observed that a similarity visual juxtaposition evoked higher levels of surprise and expectations to share message content than a comparison juxtaposition or control condition immediately following message exposure; however, visual juxtapositions had no direct effects on unhealthy consumption expectations immediately following exposure or one-week following exposure.

123,32340903,Link between gut microbiota and health outcomes in inulin -treated obese patients: Lessons from the Food4Gut multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND


The gut microbiota is altered in obesity and is strongly influenced by nutrients and xenobiotics. We have tested the impact of native inulin as prebiotic present in vegetables and added as a supplement on gut microbiota-related outcomes in obese patients. Metformin treatment was analyzed as a potential modulator of the response.
METHODS


A randomized, single-blinded, multicentric, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 150 obese patients who received 16 g/d native inulin versus maltodextrin, coupled to dietary advice to consume inulin-rich versus -poor vegetables for 3 months, respectively, in addition to dietary caloric restriction. Anthropometry, diagnostic imaging (abdominal CT-scan, fibroscan), food-behavior questionnaires, serum biology and fecal microbiome (primary outcome; 16S rDNA sequencing) were analyzed before and after the intervention.
RESULTS


Both placebo and prebiotic interventions lowered energy intake, BMI, systolic blood pressure, and serum γ-GT. The prebiotic induced greater weight loss and additionally decreased diastolic blood pressure, AST and insulinemia. Metformin treatment compromised most of the gut microbiota changes and metabolic improvements linked to prebiotic intervention. The prebiotic modulated specific bacteria, associated with the improvement of anthropometry (i.e. a decrease in Desulfovibrio and Clostridium sensu stricto). A large increase in Bifidobacterium appears as a signature of inulin intake rather than a driver of prebiotic-linked biological outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS


Inulin-enriched diet is able to promote weight loss in obese patients, the treatment efficiency being related to gut microbiota characteristics. This treatment is more efficacious in patients who did not receive metformin as anti-diabetic drugs prior the intervention, supporting that both drug treatment and microbiota might be taken into account in personalized nutrition interventions.

124,32340904,Effect of a leucine-rich supplement in combination with nutrition and physical exercise in advanced cancer patients: A randomized controlled intervention trial.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS


Branched-chain amino acids and specifically leucine stimulate protein synthesis and may overcome an anabolic resistance in malnourished and cachectic cancer patients. Therefore, we hypothesized that the addition of a leucine-rich supplement to a multimodal therapy improves physical function in advanced cancer patients.
METHODS


This single center, randomized trial examined a multimodal therapy over 12 weeks in patients with advanced cancer. The intervention group received a leucine-rich supplement in combination with a nutrition and physical exercise program. Patients in the control group received standard care. Primary endpoint was physical function measured with the short physical performance battery (SPPB). Secondary endpoints were further physical performance tests, nutritional status, dietary intake, fatigue, quality of life (QoL) and clinical course. All parameters were evaluated at baseline, after three and at six months.
RESULTS


23 women and 29 men with an average age of 63.1 ± 10.3 (range 30-81) years and BMI of 25.4 ± 4.7 kg/m 2  were randomized either to the intervention (n = 27) or control (n = 25) group. Patients in the intervention group joined a mean of 28.4 ± 7.4 training sessions (78.8%), 3.2 ± 0.6 nutritional counselling sessions (106.7%) and consumed on average 85.4 ± 33.2 supplements (71.2%). Inter-group comparison showed no significant difference in the primary endpoint SPPB after three (p = 0.184, 95% CI: -1.43, 0.29) and six months (p = 0.986, 95% CI: -0.87, 0.89). However, the secondary endpoint handgrip strength improved significantly from 35.8 ± 9.8 kg at baseline to 37.6 ± 10.0 kg at three months in the intervention group compared to 35.7 ± 8.8 kg at baseline to 34.0 ± 10.1 kg at three months in the control group (p < 0.001, 95% CI: -6.03, -1.97). The inter-group difference for changes in the further secondary endpoints nutritional status, dietary intake, fatigue, QoL and clinical course showed a trend towards an improvement in the intervention group, however, the differences were not significant after three and six months.
CONCLUSIONS


The present trial demonstrated a good adherence to the multimodal therapy as well as a significant improvement of handgrip strength in patients with advanced cancer. In addition, the clinical course data underlined the safety of the program.

125,32340906,Assessment of conduction anesthesia effectiveness using the angulated needle approach for the inferior alveolar nerve block.,"BACKGROUND


Ambulatory painless surgery is dependent on local anesthesia effectiveness.
AIM


Evaluating the anesthetic efficacy of the angulated needle approach (ANA) for the inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB).
MATERIAL AND METHOD


Group I received direct IANB; group II received indirect IANB; group III received the IANB with ANA. The quality of anesthesia score (QAS), numerical pain intensity score (NRS), onset time of full anesthesia (OT), and perianesthetic complications were measured.
RESULTS


Ninety patients (mean age: 37.47 ± 18.90, p = 0.027) of both sexes were split into three equal groups. Group III had the lowest QAS value with the success rate of 93.3%, compared to the statistically significantly worse QAS values of group II, with the success rate of 80% (p = 0.016). Group II had the statistically significant highest NRS values relative to group I (p = 0.002) and group III (p = 0.000001). The shortest OT occurred in group I, when compared to group II (p = 0.000484) and group III (p = 0.000498). The transient syncope and positive aspiration occurred in single cases.

126,32340910,The impact of heart rate-based drowsiness monitoring on adverse driving events in heavy vehicle drivers under naturalistic conditions.,"OBJECTIVES


This study examined the influence of a wrist-worn heart rate drowsiness detection device on heavy vehicle driver safety and sleep and its ability to predict driving events under naturalistic conditions.
DESIGN


Prospective, non-randomized trial.
SETTING


Naturalistic driving in Malaysia.
PARTICIPANTS


Heavy vehicle drivers in Malaysia were assigned to the Device (n = 25) or Control condition (n = 34).
INTERVENTION


Both conditions were monitored for driving events at work over 4-weeks in Phase 1, and 12-weeks in Phase 2. In Phase 1, the Device condition wore the device operated in the silent mode (i.e., no drowsiness alerts) to examine the accuracy of the device in predicting driving events. In Phase 2, the Device condition wore the device in the active mode to examine if drowsiness alerts from the device influenced the rate of driving events (compared to Phase 1).
MEASUREMENTS


All participants were monitored for harsh braking and harsh acceleration driving events and self-reported sleep duration and sleepiness daily.
RESULTS


There was a significant decrease in the rate of harsh braking events (Rate ratio = 0.48, p < 0.05) and a fall in subjective sleepiness (p < 0.05) when the device was operated in the active mode (compared to the silent mode). The device predicted when no driving events were occurring (specificity=98.81%), but had low accuracy in detecting when a driving event did occur (sensitivity=6.25%).

127,32341244,Magnitude and Reliability of Velocity and Power Variables During Deadlifts Performed With and Without Lifting Straps.,"Jukic, I, García-Ramos, A, Malecek, J, Omcirk, D, and Tufano, JJ. Magnitude and reliability of velocity and power variables during deadlifts performed with and without lifting straps. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2020-This study aimed to compare the magnitude and reliability of mean velocity (MV), peak velocity (PV), mean power (MP), and peak power (PP) between deadlifts performed with (DLw) and without (DLn) lifting straps. Sixteen resistance-trained men performed a DLn 1-repetition maximum (1RM) session followed by 4 experimental sessions (2 with each deadlift variant in a randomized order). Each experimental session comprised lifts at 20, 40, 60, and 80% of the DLn 1RM. No significant differences were found between DLw and DLn for MV, MP, PV, and PP at any load (p = 0.309-1.00; g = 0.00-0.19). All mechanical variables showed an acceptable reliability for both deadlift conditions at each relative load (coefficient of variation [CV] <8%; intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] > 0.70; g < 0.5) with the only exception of MV at 60% 1RM for DLw (ICC = 0.62) and at 40% 1RM for DLn (ICC = 0.65). Furthermore, MV and PV generally had lower within-subject CV (CV = 3.56-5.86%) than MP and PP (CV = 3.82-8.05%) during both deadlift conditions. Our findings suggest that sport professionals might not need to consider implementing lifting straps with the aim to maximize velocity and power outputs with submaximal loads in a deadlift exercise. Because all mechanical variables measured showed an acceptable level of reliability for both DLw and DLn, they can all be used to track changes in performance during the deadlift exercise. However, velocity variables were slightly more consistent (lower CV), which makes them more appropriate to track DLw and DLn performance changes.",2020,"No significant differences were found between DLw and DLn for MV, MP, PV, and PP at any load (p = 0.309-1.00;",['Sixteen resistance-trained men performed a'],"['J Strength Cond Res XX(X', 'DLn 1-repetition maximum (1RM) session followed by 4 experimental sessions']","['Magnitude and Reliability of Velocity and Power Variables', 'magnitude and reliability of mean velocity (MV), peak velocity (PV), mean power (MP), and peak power (PP) between deadlifts performed with (DLw) and without (DLn) lifting straps', 'DLw and DLn for MV, MP, PV, and PP at any load']","[{'cui': 'C3715157', 'cui_str': '16'}, {'cui': 'C0162535', 'cui_str': 'Electrical Resistance'}, {'cui': 'C0336809', 'cui_str': 'Railway train'}, {'cui': 'C0025266', 'cui_str': 'Man'}, {'cui': 'C0884358', 'cui_str': 'Performed'}]","[{'cui': 'C1856054', 'cui_str': 'Hutterite cerebroosteonephrodysplasia syndrome'}, {'cui': 'C0205341', 'cui_str': 'Repeat'}, {'cui': 'C0806909', 'cui_str': 'Max'}, {'cui': 'C0332282', 'cui_str': 'Following'}]","[{'cui': 'C0449286', 'cui_str': 'Degree'}, {'cui': 'C0035035', 'cui_str': 'Reliability (Epidemiology)'}, {'cui': 'C0439830', 'cui_str': 'Velocity'}, {'cui': 'C0439828', 'cui_str': 'Variable'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0444505', 'cui_str': 'Peak'}, {'cui': 'C0884358', 'cui_str': 'Performed'}, {'cui': 'C0181620', 'cui_str': 'Hoist'}, {'cui': 'C0183631', 'cui_str': 'Strap'}]",,0.0435985,"No significant differences were found between DLw and DLn for MV, MP, PV, and PP at any load (p = 0.309-1.00;","[{'ForeName': 'Ivan', 'Initials': 'I', 'LastName': 'Jukic', 'Affiliation': 'Sport Performance Research Institute New Zealand (SPRINZ), Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Amador', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'García-Ramos', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physical Education and Sport, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jan', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Malecek', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physiology and Biochemistry, Faculty of Physical Education and Sport, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'ForeName': 'Dan', 'Initials': 'D', 'LastName': 'Omcirk', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physiology and Biochemistry, Faculty of Physical Education and Sport, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'ForeName': 'James J', 'Initials': 'JJ', 'LastName': 'Tufano', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physiology and Biochemistry, Faculty of Physical Education and Sport, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.'}]",Journal of strength and conditioning research,['10.1519/JSC.0000000000003608']
128,32341247,Ischemic Preconditioning Attenuates Rating of Perceived Exertion But Does Not Improve Maximal Oxygen Consumption or Maximal Power Output.,"ter Beek, F, Jokumsen, PS, Sloth, BN, Thomas Stevenson, AJ, and Larsen, RG. Ischemic preconditioning attenuates rating of perceived exertion but does not improve maximal oxygen consumption or maximal power output. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2020-Brief consecutive periods of limb ischemia and reperfusion, known as ischemic preconditioning (IPC), have been reported to increase maximal power output (MPO) during cycling. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of IPC on MPO, maximal oxygen consumption (V[Combining Dot Above]O2max), muscle oxygenation, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) during an incremental cycling test. Fourteen healthy young men participated in this double-blinded, randomized crossover study, involving IPC (250 mm Hg; four 5-minute cycles of ischemia) and sham (20 mm Hg) treatment followed by an incremental cycling test to exhaustion. During the cycling test, V[Combining Dot Above]O2, RPE, heart rate (HR), blood lactate (BL), and muscle oxygenation and deoxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy) were measured. MPO, V[Combining Dot Above]O2max, HRmax, and muscle deoxygenation did not change with IPC (all p-values > 0.13). Furthermore, IPC had no significant effect on V[Combining Dot Above]O2, HR, or muscle oxygenation during the incremental cycling test (all p-values > 0.18). However, IPC attenuated RPE during cycling at 210 W (IPC: median 17.0 [interquartile range 15.3-19.0]; sham: 17.5 [17.0-19.0]; p = 0.007) and 245 W (IPC: 18.0 [17.0-18.8]; sham: 19.0 [18.0-19.8]; p = 0.011). A single session of IPC did not improve MPO, V[Combining Dot Above]O2max, or measures of oxygen consumption during the cycling test. However, IPC lowered RPE at 210 and 245 W, suggesting that IPC may attenuate the perception of effort at higher submaximal exercise intensities.",2020,"A single session of IPC did not improve MPO,",['Fourteen healthy young men'],"['Ischemic Preconditioning Attenuates Rating of Perceived Exertion', 'J Strength Cond Res XX(X', 'V[Combining', 'limb ischemia and reperfusion, known as ischemic preconditioning (IPC', 'Ischemic preconditioning', 'ischemia) and sham (20 mm Hg) treatment followed by an incremental cycling test to exhaustion', 'IPC']","['Dot Above]O2max), muscle oxygenation, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE', 'maximal oxygen consumption or maximal power output', 'V[Combining', 'Dot Above]O2max, HRmax, and muscle deoxygenation', 'MPO, maximal oxygen consumption ', 'Dot Above]O2max, or measures of oxygen consumption', 'ter Beek, F, Jokumsen, PS, Sloth, BN, Thomas Stevenson, AJ, and Larsen, RG', 'V[Combining Dot Above]O2, RPE, heart rate (HR), blood lactate (BL), and muscle oxygenation and deoxygenation (near-infrared spectroscopy', 'IPC attenuated RPE', 'maximal power output (MPO', 'Dot Above]O2, HR, or muscle oxygenation', 'Maximal Oxygen Consumption or Maximal Power Output']","[{'cui': 'C3715152', 'cui_str': '14'}, {'cui': 'C0332239', 'cui_str': 'Young'}, {'cui': 'C0025266', 'cui_str': 'Man'}]","[{'cui': 'C0376466', 'cui_str': 'Ischemic Pre-Conditioning'}, {'cui': 'C0030971', 'cui_str': 'Perception'}, {'cui': 'C0015264', 'cui_str': 'Exertion'}, {'cui': 'C1856054', 'cui_str': 'Hutterite cerebroosteonephrodysplasia syndrome'}, {'cui': 'C2945695', 'cui_str': 'Limb ischemia'}, {'cui': 'C0035124', 'cui_str': 'Reperfusion'}, {'cui': 'C0205309', 'cui_str': 'Known'}, {'cui': 'C0022116', 'cui_str': 'Ischemia'}, {'cui': 'C0073980', 'cui_str': 'salicylhydroxamic acid'}, {'cui': 'C0039798', 'cui_str': 'therapy'}, {'cui': 'C0332282', 'cui_str': 'Following'}, {'cui': 'C0003647', 'cui_str': 'Aptitude Tests'}, {'cui': 'C0392674', 'cui_str': 'Exhaustion'}]","[{'cui': 'C1720485', 'cui_str': 'Corneal epithelial dots'}, {'cui': 'C0026845', 'cui_str': 'Muscle tissue'}, {'cui': 'C0231940', 'cui_str': 'Alveolar ventilation (V)'}, {'cui': 'C0030971', 'cui_str': 'Perception'}, {'cui': 'C0015264', 'cui_str': 'Exertion'}, {'cui': 'C0205289', 'cui_str': 'Maximal'}, {'cui': 'C0030055', 'cui_str': 'Body oxygen consumption'}, {'cui': 'C0445194', 'cui_str': 'Power output'}, {'cui': 'C0079809', 'cui_str': 'Measure'}, {'cui': 'C0037331', 'cui_str': 'Sloths'}, {'cui': 'C0175778', 'cui_str': 'Larsen syndrome'}, {'cui': 'C0018810', 'cui_str': 'Heart rate'}, {'cui': 'C0005767', 'cui_str': 'Blood'}, {'cui': 'C0022924', 'cui_str': 'Lactates'}, {'cui': 'C0376519', 'cui_str': 'Near-infrared spectroscopy'}, {'cui': 'C0376466', 'cui_str': 'Ischemic Pre-Conditioning'}, {'cui': 'C0332161', 'cui_str': 'Attenuated by'}]",14.0,0.347939,"A single session of IPC did not improve MPO,","[{'ForeName': 'Frank', 'Initials': 'F', 'LastName': 'Ter Beek', 'Affiliation': 'Sports Sciences, Department of Health Science and Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.'}, {'ForeName': 'Peter S', 'Initials': 'PS', 'LastName': 'Jokumsen', 'Affiliation': 'Sports Sciences, Department of Health Science and Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.'}, {'ForeName': 'Birgitte N', 'Initials': 'BN', 'LastName': 'Sloth', 'Affiliation': 'Sports Sciences, Department of Health Science and Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.'}, {'ForeName': 'Andrew J T', 'Initials': 'AJT', 'LastName': 'Stevenson', 'Affiliation': 'Neural Engineering and Neurophysiology, Department of Health Science and Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.

129,32341291,Test-Retest Reliability and the Effects of Exercise on the King-Devick Test.,"OBJECTIVE


To determine the test-retest reliability and the influence of exercise on King-Devick (K-D) test performance.
DESIGN


Crossover study design.
SETTING


Controlled laboratory.
PARTICIPANTS


Participants consisted of 63 (39 women and 24 men) healthy, recreationally active college students who were 21.0 + 1.5 years of age.
INDEPENDENT VARIABLES


Participants completed the K-D test using a 2-week, test-retest interval. The K-D test was administered before and after a counterbalanced exercise or rest intervention. Reliability was assessed using testing visits (visit 1 and visit 2) as the independent variables. Exercise or rest and time (baseline, postintervention) were used as independent variables to examine the influence of exercise.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES


Intraclass correlation (ICC) coefficients with 95% confidence intervals were calculated between visits to assess reliability of K-D test completion time. A repeated-measure 2 x 2 analysis of variance (intervention × time) with post hoc paired t tests was used to assess the influence of exercise on K-D test performance.
RESULTS


The K-D test was observed to have strong test-retest reliability [ICC2,1 = 0.90 (0.71, 0.96)] over time. No significant intervention-by-time interaction (P = 0.55) or intervention main effects (P = 0.68) on K-D time were observed. Mean differences of -1.5 and -1.7 seconds (P < 0.001) were observed between baseline and rest and exercise interventions for K-D test performance, respectively. Up to 32% (20/63) of participants were observed to have a false-positive K-D test performance before and after each intervention.
CONCLUSIONS


Although strong test-retest reliability coefficients were observed using clinically relevant time points, a high false-positive rate warrants caution when interpreting the K-D test.",2020,"Up to 32% (20/63) of participants were observed to have a false-positive K-D test performance before and after each intervention.

130,32341295,"Intra-individual comparison of cytokine and prostaglandin levels with and without low-energy, high-frequency femtosecond laser cataract pretreatment following single-dose topical NSAID application.","PURPOSE


To investigate interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and total prostaglandin levels in the anterior chamber in patients undergoing low pulse energy femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery.
METHODS


Forty patients undergoing immediate sequential cataract surgery received randomized low-energy femtosecond laser pretreatment in 1 eye and conventional phacoemulsification in the other. Aqueous humor was collected precisely 5 minutes after femtosecond laser pretreatment and before conventional phacoemulsification from all 80 eyes. IL-1β, IL-6 and total prostaglandin (including PGE1, PGE2; PGF1a, PGF2a) levels were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunoassay kits. One drop of ketorolac 0.5% was administered 30 minutes before surgery.
RESULTS


Mean concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6 and total prostaglandin were 0.87, 0.67 and 32.19 pg/mL in the femto group compared to 0.10 (p= 0.36), 0.78 (p= 0.79) and 19.66 pg/mL (p < 0.05) in the non-femto group. Levels of IL 1β and 6 were not statistically significantly different when compared between groups. There was a small though statistically significant increase of prostaglandin levels in the femto group. There were no statistically significant correlations between levels of 1β, IL-6 or total prostaglandin and suction time or lens density (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS


Low pulse energy femtosecond laser pretreatment did not trigger any additional IL and only a small though statistically significant increase of prostaglandin release in the anterior chamber after a single-dose of topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug administered 30 minutes before the start of cataract surgery. The findings indicated that the minor inflammatory reaction was due to the lower pulse energy concept applied by the femtosecond laser.",2020,"There were no statistically significant correlations between levels of 1β, IL-6 or total prostaglandin and suction time or lens density (p > 0.05).

131,32341838,A comparative study of aceclofenac versus etoricoxib in the management of acute low back pain in a tertiary care hospital.,"Background:  The aim of management of acute low back pain is to alleviate the pain quickly and improve functional ability. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first line of treatment. The challenge lies in deciding which NSAIDs will provide greater symptomatic relief, while also being cost-effective.  Objective:  To compare the effectiveness of aceclofenac and etoricoxib in the management of acute low back pain.  Methods:  This prospective, open label, observational study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Patients over 18 years of age and presenting with low back pain of less than 6 weeks duration were enrolled in the study. Fifty patients with non-specific low back pain were randomized into two groups: Group A received aceclofenac (2 mg/kg) twice a day and Group B received etoricoxib (1 mg/kg) twice a day for 1 week. The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and Oswestry Low Back Disability Index (ODI) determined the clinically meaningful outcomes.  Results:  The decrease in pain intensity in Group A was 52.27%, while in Group B it was 62.53%. However, the decrease in pain scores between the groups was not statistically significant ( p  = .3795). Improvement in functional ability in Group A and Group B was 57.01% and 61.48%, respectively. However, this improvement between the groups was not statistically significant ( p  > .999) at the end of 1 week. The average cost-effectiveness ratio indicated that etoricoxib was the dominant treatment over aceclofenac. Therefore, etoricoxib was found to be the cost-effective option for short-term pain relief in acute low back pain for 1 week.  Conclusion:  Both aceclofenac and etoricoxib were clinically effective in reducing the pain intensity and in improving functional ability. However, etoricoxib was found to be the cost-effective intervention.",2020,"The decrease in pain intensity in Group A was 52.27%, while in Group B it was 62.53%.","['acute low back pain in a tertiary care hospital', 'Patients over 18\u2009years of age and presenting with low back pain of less than 6\u2009weeks duration were enrolled in the study', 'Fifty patients with non-specific low back pain']","['etoricoxib', 'aceclofenac versus etoricoxib', 'aceclofenac and etoricoxib', 'aceclofenac']","['pain scores', 'pain intensity', 'average cost-effectiveness ratio', 'Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and Oswestry Low Back Disability Index (ODI', 'functional ability']","[{'cui': 'C0457950', 'cui_str': 'Acute low back pain'}, {'cui': 'C0337954', 'cui_str': 'Tertiary care hospital'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0150312', 'cui_str': 'Present'}, {'cui': 'C0024031', 'cui_str': 'Low back pain'}, {'cui': 'C0439092', 'cui_str': '<'}, {'cui': 'C0439230', 'cui_str': 'week'}, {'cui': 'C0449238', 'cui_str': 'Duration'}, {'cui': 'C0008972', 'cui_str': 'Clinical Study'}, {'cui': 'C0205370', 'cui_str': 'Non-specific'}]","[{'cui': 'C0972314', 'cui_str': 'etoricoxib'}, {'cui': 'C0050403', 'cui_str': 'aceclofenac'}]","[{'cui': 'C0582148', 'cui_str': 'Pain score'}, {'cui': 'C1320357', 'cui_str': 'Pain intensity'}, {'cui': 'C0010181', 'cui_str': 'Cost Effectiveness'}, {'cui': 'C0456603', 'cui_str': 'Ratio'}, {'cui': 'C0237753', 'cui_str': 'Number'}, {'cui': 'C0175659', 'cui_str': 'Scale'}, {'cui': 'C0205251', 'cui_str': 'Low'}, {'cui': 'C0231170', 'cui_str': 'Disability'}, {'cui': 'C0600653', 'cui_str': 'Indexes'}, {'cui': 'C0001288', 'cui_str': 'Activity of daily living'}]",50.0,0.0231599,"The decrease in pain intensity in Group A was 52.27%, while in Group B it was 62.53%.","[{'ForeName': 'Hema', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Jagannathan', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pain Management, Pharmacy Practice, Visveswarapura Institution of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Bangalore, India.'}, {'ForeName': 'Amulya', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Thota', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pain Management, Pharmacy Practice, Visveswarapura Institution of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Bangalore, India.'}, {'ForeName': 'Ashok Kumar', 'Initials': 'AK', 'LastName': 'B Kumarappa', 'Affiliation': 'Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences, Bangalore, India.'}, {'ForeName': 'Githa', 'Initials': 'G', 'LastName': 'Kishore', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pain Management, Pharmacy Practice, Visveswarapura Institution of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Bangalore, India.'}]",Journal of drug assessment,['10.1080/21556660.2020.1734008']
132,32342016,Cognitive-behavioural therapy combined with music therapy for chronic fatigue following Epstein-Barr virus infection in adolescents: a feasibility study.,"​Background


Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is effective in chronic fatigue syndrome. However, CBT has not been investigated in postinfectious chronic fatigue (CF), nor is it known whether addition of therapeutic elements from other disciplines might be feasible. We studied the feasibility of a combined CBT and music therapy intervention for CF following Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in adolescents.
​Methods


Adolescents (12-20 years old) participating in a postinfectious cohort study who developed CF 6 months after an acute EBV infection were eligible for the present feasibility study. A combined CBT and music therapy programme (10 therapy sessions and related homework) was compared with care as usual in a randomised controlled design. Therapists and participants were blinded to outcome evaluation. Endpoints included physical activity (steps/day), symptom scores, recovery rate and possible harmful effects, but the study was underpowered regarding efficacy. Total follow-up time was 15 months.
​Results


A total of 43 individuals with postinfectious CF were included (21 intervention group, 22 control group). Seven individuals left the study during the first 3 months, leaving 15 in the intervention group and 21 in the control group at 3 months' follow-up. No harmful effects were recorded, and compliance with appointment was high. In intention-to-treat analyses, number of steps/day tended to decrease (difference=-1158, 95% CI -2642 to 325), whereas postexertional malaise tended to improve (difference=-0.4, 95% CI -0.9 to 0.1) in the intervention group at 3 months. At 15 months' follow-up, there was a trend towards higher recovery rate in the intervention group (62% vs 37%).
​Conclusion


An intervention study of combined CBT and music therapy in postinfectious CF is feasible, and appears acceptable to the participants. The tendencies towards positive effects on patients' symptoms and recovery might justify a full-scale clinical trial.

133,32342022,Toward a Treatment Normalizing Ovulation Rate in Adolescent Girls With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.,"Adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by androgen excess and oligomenorrhea, and commonly driven by hepato-visceral fat excess (""central obesity"") ensuing from a mismatch between prenatal and postnatal nutrition, on a background of genetic susceptibility. There is no approved treatment for adolescent PCOS. We report the pooled results of 2 pilot studies in nonobese girls with PCOS (N = 62, age 15.8 years) that compared the effects of randomized treatment for 1 year, either with an oral estro-progestogen contraceptive (OC), or with a low-dose combination of spironolactone-pioglitazone-metformin (SPIOMET, targeting the excess of ectopic fat). Auxological and endocrine-metabolic variables (including fasting insulin, androgens, high-molecular-weight adiponectin [HMW-adiponectin], and microRNA [miR]-451a), body composition (dual x-ray absorptiometry) and hepato-visceral fat (magnetic resonance imaging) were assessed on- and posttreatment. Data from menstrual diaries were combined with weekly salivary progesterone measurements to infer ovulation rates during the second and fourth quarter of the posttreatment year. OC and SPIOMET treatment reduced the androgen excess comparably, and had no differential effects on total-body lean or fat mass. However, SPIOMET was accompanied by more broadly normalizing effects, including on hepato-visceral fat and on circulating insulin, HMW-adiponectin, and miR-451a. On average, there were 3-fold more ovulations post-SPIOMET than post-OC; normovulation was only observed after SPIOMET; anovulation was >10-fold more prevalent post-OC. Pooled results of randomized studies in nonobese adolescent girls with PCOS indicate that SPIOMET treatment leads to an overall healthier, more insulin-sensitive condition-with less ectopic fat-than OC treatment, and to a more normal posttreatment ovulation rate.",2020,"OC and SPIOMET treatment reduced the androgen excess comparably, and had no differential effects on total-body lean or fat mass.","['Adolescent Girls', 'nonobese adolescent girls with PCOS', 'nonobese girls with PCOS (N = 62, age 15.8 years', 'Adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS', 'With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome']","['oral estro-progestogen contraceptive (OC), or with a low-dose combination of spironolactone-pioglitazone-metformin']","['Ovulation Rate', 'hepato-visceral fat and on circulating insulin, HMW-adiponectin, and miR-451a', 'Auxological and endocrine-metabolic variables (including fasting insulin, androgens, high-molecular-weight adiponectin [HMW-adiponectin], and microRNA [miR]-451a), body composition (dual x-ray absorptiometry) and hepato-visceral fat (magnetic resonance imaging', 'ovulation rates', 'total-body lean or fat mass']","[{'cui': 'C0001588', 'cui_str': 'Adolescents, Female'}, {'cui': 'C0032460', 'cui_str': 'Polycystic ovary syndrome'}, {'cui': 'C0043210', 'cui_str': 'Woman'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C5191316', 'cui_str': '15.8'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0205653', 'cui_str': 'Adolescent'}]","[{'cui': 'C0226896', 'cui_str': 'Oral cavity structure'}, {'cui': 'C0033306', 'cui_str': 'Progestational hormone'}, {'cui': 'C0009871', 'cui_str': 'Contraceptive agent'}, {'cui': 'C0445550', 'cui_str': 'Low dose'}, {'cui': 'C0037982', 'cui_str': 'Spironolactone'}, {'cui': 'C0071097', 'cui_str': 'pioglitazone'}, {'cui': 'C0025598', 'cui_str': 'Metformin'}]","[{'cui': 'C0029965', 'cui_str': 'Ovulation'}, {'cui': 'C1563740', 'cui_str': 'Abdominal Visceral Fat'}, {'cui': 'C0175630', 'cui_str': 'Circulating'}, {'cui': 'C0021641', 'cui_str': 'Insulin'}, {'cui': 'C0389071', 'cui_str': 'Adiponectin'}, {'cui': 'C1101610', 'cui_str': 'MicroRNA'}, {'cui': 'C0014136', 'cui_str': 'Structure of endocrine system'}, {'cui': 'C0439828', 'cui_str': 'Variable'}, {'cui': 'C0332257', 'cui_str': 'Including'}, {'cui': 'C0015663', 'cui_str': 'Fasting'}, {'cui': 'C0002844', 'cui_str': 'Androgen'}, {'cui': 'C2733715', 'cui_str': 'High molecular weight adiponectin'}, {'cui': 'C0005885', 'cui_str': 'Body composition'}, {'cui': 'C1510486', 'cui_str': 'Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry'}, {'cui': 'C0024485', 'cui_str': 'Magnetic resonance imaging'}, {'cui': 'C0439810', 'cui_str': 'Total'}, {'cui': 'C0152338', 'cui_str': 'Structure of body of caudate nucleus'}, {'cui': 'C0015677', 'cui_str': 'Fat'}, {'cui': 'C0577559', 'cui_str': 'Mass of body structure'}]",62.0,0.0770526,"OC and SPIOMET treatment reduced the androgen excess comparably, and had no differential effects on total-body lean or fat mass.","[{'ForeName': 'Lourdes', 'Initials': 'L', 'LastName': 'Ibáñez', 'Affiliation': 'Institut de Recerca Pediàtric Hospital Sant Joan de Déu, University of Barcelona, Esplugues, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Marta', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Díaz', 'Affiliation': 'Institut de Recerca Pediàtric Hospital Sant Joan de Déu, University of Barcelona, Esplugues, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Cristina', 'Initials': 'C', 'LastName': 'García-Beltrán', 'Affiliation': 'Institut de Recerca Pediàtric Hospital Sant Joan de Déu, University of Barcelona, Esplugues, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Rita', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Malpique', 'Affiliation': 'Institut de Recerca Pediàtric Hospital Sant Joan de Déu, University of Barcelona, Esplugues, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Edurne', 'Initials': 'E', 'LastName': 'Garde', 'Affiliation': 'Institut de Recerca Pediàtric Hospital Sant Joan de Déu, University of Barcelona, Esplugues, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Abel', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'López-Bermejo', 'Affiliation': 'Pediatric Endocrinology Research Group, Girona Institute for Biomedical Research (IDIBGI) and Dr. Josep Trueta Hospital, Girona, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Francis', 'Initials': 'F', 'LastName': 'de Zegher', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Development & Regeneration, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.'}]",Journal of the Endocrine Society,['10.1210/jendso/bvaa032']
134,32347764,Air Pollutant Exposure and Stove Use Assessment Methods for the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) Trial.,"BACKGROUND


High quality personal exposure data is fundamental to understanding the health implications of household energy interventions, interpreting analyses across assigned study arms, and characterizing exposure-response relationships for household air pollution. This paper describes the exposure data collection for the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN), a multicountry randomized controlled trial of liquefied petroleum gas stoves and fuel among 3,200 households in India, Rwanda, Guatemala, and Peru.
OBJECTIVES


The primary objectives of the exposure assessment are to estimate the exposure contrast achieved following a clean fuel intervention and to provide data for analyses of exposure-response relationships across a range of personal exposures.
METHODS


Exposure measurements are being conducted over the 3-y time frame of the field study. We are measuring fine particulate matter [PM  <   2.5 μ m  in aerodynamic diameter ( PM 2.5 )] with the Enhanced Children's MicroPEM™ (RTI International), carbon monoxide (CO) with the USB-EL-CO (Lascar Electronics), and black carbon with the OT21 transmissometer (Magee Scientific) in pregnant women, adult women, and children  < 1   year  of age, primarily via multiple 24-h personal assessments (three, six, and three measurements, respectively) over the course of the 18-month follow-up period using lightweight monitors. For children we are using an indirect measurement approach, combining data from area monitors and locator devices worn by the child. For a subsample (up to 10%) of the study population, we are doubling the frequency of measurements in order to estimate the accuracy of subject-specific typical exposure estimates. In addition, we are conducting ambient air monitoring to help characterize potential contributions of  PM 2.5  exposure from background concentration. Stove use monitors (Geocene) are being used to assess compliance with the intervention, given that stove stacking (use of traditional stoves in addition to the intervention gas stove) may occur.
CONCLUSIONS


The tools and approaches being used for HAPIN to estimate personal exposures build on previous efforts and take advantage of new technologies. In addition to providing key personal exposure data for this study, we hope the application and learnings from our exposure assessment will help inform future efforts to characterize exposure to household air pollution and for other contexts. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6422.",2020,"[PM  <   2.5 μ m  in aerodynamic diameter ( PM 2.5 )] with the Enhanced Children's MicroPEM™ (RTI

135,32342101,When Brain Stimulation Backfires: The Effects of Prefrontal Cortex Stimulation on Impulsivity.,"Transcranial direct current stimulation can sometimes cause the opposite of its intended effect. These reverse effects may be related in part to individual differences in personality and neurochemistry. Previous studies have demonstrated that dopamine levels can impact the effects of tDCS. In the present study, 124 healthy participants took the UPPS Impulsive Behavior scale. Participants then underwent a single, randomized anodal or sham tDCS session on the prefrontal cortex.

137,32342139,A randomized controlled trial assessing the effects of preoperative strengthening plus balance training on balance and functional outcome up to 1 year following total knee replacement.,"PURPOSE


To investigate the effects of including balance training in a preoperative strengthening intervention on balance and functional outcomes in patients undergoing total knee replacement (TKR) and compare these effects to those induced by preoperative strengthening and no intervention.
METHODS


Eighty-two subjects scheduled for TKR were randomly allocated into the strengthening (ST, n = 28) group: a preoperative lower limb strengthening intervention; the strengthening + balance (ST + B, n = 28) group: same intervention augmented with balance training; and the control group (n = 26). The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the function in daily living subscale of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS-ADL) were the primary outcomes. The secondary measures included balance and mobility, self-reported status, and knee function. The outcomes were assessed at baseline, 1 week before surgery, and 2, (primary endpoint), 6 and 52 weeks after surgery.
RESULTS


Compared with the controls, the participants in the ST and ST + B groups presented significant improvements from baseline to the end of the preoperative intervention in BBS (p = 0.005) and KOOS-ADL (p < 0.001). At 6 weeks post-surgery, the knee extensor strength values were similar in the two treatment groups and significantly higher than that in the controls. Overall, the participant outcomes in all groups stabilized at 1 year after surgery.
CONCLUSION


A preoperative strengthening intervention, regardless of whether it is complemented with balance training, enhances strength but not balance or functional outcomes at 6 weeks after surgery. Patients are expected to present similar performance at 1 year postoperatively, but adequately statistically powered trials are needed to confirm the findings.

A total of 569 emergency department patients were prospectively analyzed and assigned to intensive care (ICU group, n = 431) or other departments (n = 138). Uric acid (UA) levels were significantly higher in the intensive care patients (6.3 [5.1-7.6] mg/dl vs. 5.8 [4.6-6.8] mg/dL). The plasma xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) activity in the ICU group (68.3 [21.2-359.5] pmol/h/mL) was also significantly higher than that in other departments (37.2 [15.1-93.6] pmol/h/mL). Intensive care patients were divided into three groups according to plasma XOR quartiles (Q1, low-XOR, Q2/Q3, normal-XOR, and Q4, high-XOR group). A multivariate logistic regression model showed that lactate (per 1.0 mmol/L increase, OR 1.326; 95%, CI 1.166-1.508, p < 0.001) and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (per 1.0 point increase, OR 1.095, 95% CI 1.034-1.160, p = 0.002) were independently associated with the high-XOR group.

140,32342648,Do the anatomical and physiological properties of a muscle determine its adaptive response to different loading protocols?,"It has been proposed that superior muscle hypertrophy may be obtained by training muscles predominant in type I fibers with lighter loads and those predominant in type II fibers with heavier loads.
PURPOSE


To evaluate longitudinal changes in muscle strength and hypertrophy of the soleus (a predominantly slow-twitch muscle) and gastrocnemius (muscle with a similar composition of slow and fast-twitch fibers) when subjected to light (20-30 repetition maximum) and heavy (6-10 repetition maximum) load plantarflexion exercise.
METHODS


The study employed a within-subject design whereby 26 untrained young men had their lower limbs randomized to perform plantarflexion with a low-load (LIGHT) and a high-load (HEAVY) for 8 weeks. Muscle thickness was estimated via B-mode ultrasound and maximal strength was determined by isometric dynamometry.
RESULTS


Results showed that changes in muscle thickness were similar for the soleus and the gastrocnemius regardless of the magnitude of load used in training. Furthermore, each of the calf muscles demonstrated robust hypertrophy, with the lateral gastrocnemius showing greater gains compared to the medial gastrocnemius and soleus. Both HEAVY and LIGHT training programs elicited similar hypertrophic increases in the triceps surae. Finally, isometric strength increases were similar between loading conditions.
CONCLUSIONS


The triceps surae muscles respond robustly to regimented exercise and measures of muscle hypertrophy and isometric strength appear independent of muscle fiber type composition. Moreover, the study provides further evidence that low-load training is a viable strategy to increase hypertrophy in different human muscles, with hypertrophic increases similar to that observed using heavy loads.",2020,The triceps surae muscles respond robustly to regimented exercise and measures of muscle hypertrophy and isometric strength appear independent of muscle fiber type composition.,['26 untrained young men had their lower limbs randomized to'],"['HEAVY and LIGHT training', 'perform plantarflexion with a low-load (LIGHT) and a high-load (HEAVY']","['isometric strength increases', 'hypertrophic increases in the triceps surae', 'Muscle thickness', 'muscle thickness']","[{'cui': 'C0332239', 'cui_str': 'Young'}, {'cui': 'C0025266', 'cui_str': 'Man'}, {'cui': 'C0023216', 'cui_str': 'Lower limb structure'}]","[{'cui': 'C0439539', 'cui_str': 'Heavy (weight)'}, {'cui': 'C0023693', 'cui_str': 'Light'}, {'cui': 'C0040607', 'cui_str': 'Training Programs'}, {'cui': 'C0884358', 'cui_str': 'Performed'}, {'cui': 'C0205251', 'cui_str': 'Low'}, {'cui': 'C0205250', 'cui_str': 'High'}]","[{'cui': 'C0022206', 'cui_str': 'Isometric exercise'}, {'cui': 'C0205217', 'cui_str': 'Increased'}, {'cui': 'C0020564', 'cui_str': 'Hypertrophy'}, {'cui': 'C0026845', 'cui_str': 'Muscle tissue'}, {'cui': 'C1280412', 'cui_str': 'Thick'}]",26.0,0.0208311,The triceps surae muscles respond robustly to regimented exercise and measures of muscle hypertrophy and isometric strength appear independent of muscle fiber type composition.,"[{'ForeName': 'Brad J', 'Initials': 'BJ', 'LastName': 'Schoenfeld', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, CUNY Lehman College, Bronx, NY, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Andrew D', 'Initials': 'AD', 'LastName': 'Vigotsky', 'Affiliation': 'Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Statistics, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jozo', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Grgic', 'Affiliation': 'Institute for Health and Sport (IHES), Victoria University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Cody', 'Initials': 'C', 'LastName': 'Haun', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Exercise Science, LaGrange College, LaGrange, GA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Bret', 'Initials': 'B', 'LastName': 'Contreras', 'Affiliation': 'Sport Performance Research Institute, AUT University, Auckland, New Zealand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kenneth', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Delcastillo', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, CUNY Lehman College, Bronx, NY, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Aston', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Francis', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, CUNY Lehman College, Bronx, NY, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Gilda', 'Initials': 'G', 'LastName': 'Cote', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, CUNY Lehman College, Bronx, NY, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Andrew', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Alto', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, CUNY Lehman College, Bronx, NY, USA.'}]",Physiological reports,['10.14814/phy2.14427']
141,32342662,A Combined Health Action Process Approach and mHealth Intervention to Increase Non-Sedentary Behaviours in Office-Working Adults-A Randomised Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND


Office-working adults represent an at-risk population for high levels of sedentary behaviour (SB), which has been associated with an increased risk for numerous chronic diseases. This study examined the effectiveness of a Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) based planning intervention augmented with tailored text messages to reduce workplace sitting time (primary outcome) and increase specific non-SBs (i.e. standing time, walking time, stretching time, break frequency, break duration). A secondary purpose was to examine relationships among HAPA volitional constructs and sedentary and non-SBs.
METHODS


Full-time office workers (M age   = 45.18 ± 11.33 years) from Canada were randomised into either a HAPA intervention (n = 29) or control (n = 31) condition. Workplace sitting time, time spent in specific non-SBs, and HAPA volitional constructs were assessed at baseline, weeks 2, 4, 6 (post-intervention), and 8 (follow-up).
RESULTS


Significant group by time interaction effects, that favoured the intervention group, were found for sitting time (p = .003, ɳ p   2   = .07), standing time (p = .019, ɳ p   2   = .05), and stretching time (p = .001, ɳ p   2   = .08) as well as for action planning (p < .001, ɳ p   2   = .20), coping planning (p < .001, ɳ p   2   = .18), and action control (p < .001, ɳ p   2   = .15). Significant correlations (p < .05) were also found between the HAPA constructs and time spent sitting, standing, walking, as well as break frequency.
CONCLUSIONS

143,31781298,Prognostic Value of MicroRNAs in Patients after Myocardial Infarction: A Substudy of PRAGUE-18.,"Background


The evaluation of the long-term risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and cardiac death in patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an established clinical process. Laboratory markers may significantly help with the risk stratification of these patients. Our objective was to find the relation of selected microRNAs to the standard markers of AMI and determine if these microRNAs can be used to identify patients at increased risk.
Methods


Selected microRNAs (miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-499) were measured in a cohort of 122 patients from the PRAGUE-18 study (ticagrelor vs. prasugrel in AMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI)). The cohort was split into two subgroups: 116 patients who did not die (survivors) and 6 patients who died (nonsurvivors) during the 365-day period after AMI. Plasma levels of selected circulating miRNAs were then assessed in combination with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hsTnT) and N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP).
Results


miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-499 correlated positively with NT-proBNP and hsTnT 24 hours after admission and negatively with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Both miR-1 and miR-133a positively correlated with hsTnT at admission. Median relative levels of all selected miRNAs were higher in the subgroup of nonsurvivors ( N  = 6) in comparison with survivors ( N  = 116), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. All patients in the nonsurvivor subgroup had miR-499 and NT-proBNP levels above the cut-off values (891.5 ng/L for NT-proBNP and 0.088 for miR-499), whereas in the survivor subgroup, only 28.4% of patients were above the cut-off values ( p  = 0.001).
Conclusions


Statistically significant correlation was found between miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-499 and hsTnT, NT-proBNP, and LVEF. In addition, this analysis suggests that plasma levels of circulating miR-499 could contribute to the identification of patients at increased risk of death during the first year after AMI, especially when combined with NT-proBNP levels.",2019,"Statistically significant correlation was found between miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-499 and hsTnT, NT-proBNP, and LVEF.","['122 patients from the PRAGUE-18 study (ticagrelor vs. prasugrel in AMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI', 'Patients after Myocardial Infarction', 'patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI', '116 patients who did not die (survivors) and 6 patients who died (nonsurvivors) during the 365-day period after AMI']",[],"['miR-499 and NT-proBNP levels', 'miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-499 and hsTnT, NT-proBNP, and LVEF', 'Median relative levels', 'Plasma levels', 'Results\n\n\nmiR-1, miR-133a, and miR-499']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0008972', 'cui_str': 'Clinical Study'}, {'cui': 'C1999375', 'cui_str': 'Ticagrelor'}, {'cui': 'C1620287', 'cui_str': 'prasugrel'}, {'cui': 'C0155626', 'cui_str': 'Acute myocardial infarction'}, {'cui': 'C0332293', 'cui_str': 'Treated with'}, {'cui': 'C0205225', 'cui_str': 'Principal'}, {'cui': 'C1532338', 'cui_str': 'Percutaneous coronary intervention'}, {'cui': 'C0027051', 'cui_str': 'Myocardial infarction'}, {'cui': 'C4517541', 'cui_str': '116'}, {'cui': 'C1299585', 'cui_str': 'Does not'}, {'cui': 'C0011065', 'cui_str': 'Death'}, {'cui': 'C0332173', 'cui_str': 'Daily'}]",[],"[{'cui': 'C1101610', 'cui_str': 'MicroRNA'}, {'cui': 'C0205088', 'cui_str': 'End-stage'}, {'cui': 'C1144709', 'cui_str': 'Natriuretic Peptide Hormones'}, {'cui': 'C0441889', 'cui_str': 'Levels'}, {'cui': 'C0205250', 'cui_str': 'High'}, {'cui': 'C0020517', 'cui_str': 'Hypersensitivity reaction'}, {'cui': 'C0523953', 'cui_str': 'Troponin T cardiac measurement'}, {'cui': 'C0205091', 'cui_str': 'Left'}, {'cui': 'C0042508', 'cui_str': 'Ventricular Ejection Fraction'}, {'cui': 'C0549183', 'cui_str': 'Midline'}, {'cui': 'C0080103', 'cui_str': 'Relative'}, {'cui': 'C0032105', 'cui_str': 'blood plasma'}, {'cui': 'C0678226', 'cui_str': 'Due to'}]",122.0,0.130018,"Statistically significant correlation was found between miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-499 and hsTnT, NT-proBNP, and LVEF.","[{'ForeName': 'M', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Hromádka', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine of Charles University, Pilsen, Czech Republic.'}, {'ForeName': 'V', 'Initials': 'V', 'LastName': 'Černá', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Czech Republic.'}, {'ForeName': 'M', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Pešta', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Czech Republic.'}, {'ForeName': 'A', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Kučerová', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Czech Republic.'}, {'ForeName': 'J', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Jarkovský', 'Affiliation': 'Institute of Biostatistics and Analyses, Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.'}, {'ForeName': 'D', 'Initials': 'D', 'LastName': 'Rajdl', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Hematology, University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Czech Republic.'}, {'ForeName': 'R', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Rokyta', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine of Charles University, Pilsen, Czech Republic.'}, {'ForeName': 'Z', 'Initials': 'Z', 'LastName': 'Moťovská', 'Affiliation': 'Cardiocentre, Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady, Prague, Czech Republic.'}]",Disease markers,['10.1155/2019/2925019']
144,31782493,The Intervention Nurses Start Infants Growing on Healthy Trajectories (INSIGHT) responsive parenting intervention for firstborns impacts feeding of secondborns.,"BACKGROUND


The Intervention Nurses Start Infant Growing on Healthy Trajectories (INSIGHT) study's responsive parenting (RP) intervention, initiated in early infancy, prevented the use of nonresponsive, controlling feeding practices and promoted use of structure-based feeding among first-time parents compared with controls.
OBJECTIVES


We sought to examine the spillover effect of the RP intervention on maternal feeding practices with their secondborn (SB) infants enrolled in an observational-only study, SIBSIGHT, and to test the moderating effect of spacing of births.
METHODS


SB infants of mothers participating in the INSIGHT study were enrolled into the observation-only ancillary study, SIBSIGHT. SBs were healthy singleton infants ≥36 weeks of gestation. Infant feeding practices (i.e., food to soothe, structure vs. control-based practices) were assessed using validated questionnaires: Babies Need Soothing Questionnaire, Infant Feeding Styles Questionnaire, and the Structure and Control in Parent Feeding Questionnaire.
RESULTS


SBs (n = 117 [RP: 57, control: 60]; 43% male) were delivered 2.5 ± 0.8 y after firstborns (FBs). At age 1 y, the Structure and Control in Parent Feeding Questionnaire revealed that the mothers in the RP group used more consistent feeding routines (4.19 [0.43] compared with 3.77 [0.62], P = 0.0006, Cohen's D: 0.69) compared with control group mothers. From the Infant Feeding Styles Questionnaire, RP group mothers also used less nonresponsive, controlling feeding practices such as pressuring their SB infant to finish (1.81 [0.52] compared with 2.24 [0.68], P = 0.001, Cohen's D: 0.68) compared with controls. In contrast to our hypotheses, no differences were detected in bottle-feeding practices such as putting to bed with a bottle/sippy cup or adding cereal to the bottle, despite observing study group differences in FBs. Spacing of births did not moderate intervention effects.

RP guidance given to mothers of FBs may prevent the use of some nonresponsive, controlling feeding practices while establishing consistent feeding routines in subsequent siblings.",2020,"In contrast to our hypotheses, no differences were detected in bottle-feeding practices such as putting to bed with a bottle/sippy cup or adding cereal to the bottle, despite observing study group differences in FBs.","['SBs (n\xa0=\xa0117', 'healthy singleton infants ≥36 weeks of gestation', 'maternal feeding practices with their secondborn (SB) infants enrolled', 'SB infants of mothers participating in the INSIGHT study were enrolled into the observation-only ancillary study, SIBSIGHT']","['RP intervention', 'responsive parenting (RP) intervention', 'Intervention Nurses Start Infants Growing on Healthy Trajectories (INSIGHT) responsive parenting intervention for firstborns impacts feeding of secondborns']",['consistent feeding routines'],"[{'cui': 'C0003380', 'cui_str': 'Antimony'}, {'cui': 'C0021270', 'cui_str': 'Infant'}, {'cui': 'C0439230', 'cui_str': 'week'}, {'cui': 'C0032961', 'cui_str': 'Pregnancy'}, {'cui': 'C0026591', 'cui_str': 'Mother'}, {'cui': 'C0184661', 'cui_str': 'Procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0028661', 'cui_str': 'Nursing personnel'}, {'cui': 'C0439659', 'cui_str': 'Origins'}, {'cui': 'C0008972', 'cui_str': 'Clinical Study'}, {'cui': 'C0302523', 'cui_str': 'Observation'}]","[{'cui': 'C0205342', 'cui_str': 'Responsive'}, {'cui': 'C0085092', 'cui_str': 'Parenting behavior'}, {'cui': 'C0184661', 'cui_str': 'Procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0028661', 'cui_str': 'Nursing personnel'}, {'cui': 'C0439659', 'cui_str': 'Origins'}, {'cui': 'C0021270', 'cui_str': 'Infant'}, {'cui': 'C0040456', 'cui_str': 'Impacted tooth'}, {'cui': 'C0204695', 'cui_str': 'Feeding patient'}]","[{'cui': 'C0332290', 'cui_str': 'Consistent with'}, {'cui': 'C0205547', 'cui_str': 'Routine'}]",117.0,0.0224408,"In contrast to our hypotheses, no differences were detected in bottle-feeding practices such as putting to bed with a bottle/sippy cup or adding cereal to the bottle, despite observing study group differences in FBs.","[{'ForeName': 'Cara F', 'Initials': 'CF', 'LastName': 'Ruggiero', 'Affiliation': 'Center for Childhood Obesity Research, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Emily E', 'Initials': 'EE', 'LastName': 'Hohman', 'Affiliation': 'Center for Childhood Obesity Research, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Leann L', 'Initials': 'LL', 'LastName': 'Birch', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Foods and Nutrition, University of Georgia, Athens,GA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Ian M', 'Initials': 'IM', 'LastName': 'Paul', 'Affiliation': 'Pediatrics and Public Health Sciences, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jennifer S', 'Initials': 'JS', 'LastName': 'Savage', 'Affiliation': 'Center for Childhood Obesity Research, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA.'}]",The American journal of clinical nutrition,['10.1093/ajcn/nqz277']
145,30571289,Exercise intensity affects acute neurotrophic and neurophysiological responses poststroke.,"Aerobic exercise may acutely prime the brain to be more responsive to rehabilitation, thus facilitating neurologic recovery from conditions like stroke. This aerobic priming effect could occur through multiple mechanisms, including upregulation of circulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), increased corticospinal excitability, and decreased intracortical inhibition. However, optimal exercise parameters for targeting these mechanisms are poorly understood. This study tested the effects of exercise intensity on acute BDNF and neurophysiological responses. Sixteen ambulatory persons >6 mo poststroke performed three different 20-min exercise protocols in random order, approximately 1 wk apart, including the following: 1) treadmill high-intensity interval training (HIT-treadmill); 2) seated-stepper HIT (HIT-stepper); and 3) treadmill moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MCT-treadmill). Serum BDNF and transcranial magnetic stimulation measures of paretic lower limb excitability and inhibition were assessed at multiple time points during each session. Compared with MCT-treadmill, HIT-treadmill elicited significantly greater acute increases in circulating BDNF and corticospinal excitability. HIT-stepper initially showed BDNF responses similar to HIT-treadmill but was no longer significantly different from MCT-treadmill after decreasing the intensity in reaction to two hypotensive events. Additional regression analyses showed that an intensity sufficient to accumulate blood lactate appeared to be important for eliciting BDNF responses, that the interval training approach may have facilitated the corticospinal excitability increases, and that the circulating BDNF response was (negatively) related to intracortical inhibition. These findings further elucidate neurologic mechanisms of aerobic exercise and inform selection of optimal exercise-dosing parameters for enhancing acute neurologic effects. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Acute exercise-related increases in circulating BDNF and corticospinal excitability are thought to prime the brain for learning. Our data suggest that these responses can be obtained among persons with stroke using short-interval treadmill high-intensity interval training, that a vigorous aerobic intensity sufficient to generate lactate accumulation is needed to increase BDNF, that interval training facilitates increases in paretic quadriceps corticospinal excitability, and that greater BDNF response is associated with lesser intracortical inhibition response.",2019,HIT-stepper initially showed BDNF responses similar to HIT-treadmill but was no longer significantly different from MCT-treadmill after decreasing the intensity in reaction to two hypotensive events.,['Sixteen ambulatory persons >6 mo poststroke'],"['Aerobic exercise', 'treadmill high-intensity interval training (HIT-treadmill); 2) seated-stepper HIT (HIT-stepper); and 3) treadmill moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MCT-treadmill', 'aerobic exercise']","['BDNF responses', 'circulating BDNF and corticospinal excitability', 'paretic quadriceps corticospinal excitability', 'circulating BDNF response', 'acute BDNF and neurophysiological responses', 'corticospinal excitability']","[{'cui': 'C3715157', 'cui_str': '16'}, {'cui': 'C0002424', 'cui_str': 'Ambulatory care site'}, {'cui': 'C0027361', 'cui_str': 'Person'}]","[{'cui': 'C0001701', 'cui_str': 'Aerobic exercises'}, {'cui': 'C0184069', 'cui_str': 'Treadmill'}, {'cui': 'C4277545', 'cui_str': 'High-intensity interval training'}, {'cui': 'C0272285', 'cui_str': 'Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia'}, {'cui': 'C0277814', 'cui_str': 'Sitting position'}, {'cui': 'C4081855', 'cui_str': 'Moderate intensity'}, {'cui': 'C0549178', 'cui_str': 'Continuous'}, {'cui': 'C0015259', 'cui_str': 'Exercise'}, {'cui': 'C0026687', 'cui_str': 'Mucociliary clearance'}]","[{'cui': 'C0107103', 'cui_str': 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor'}, {'cui': 'C0175630', 'cui_str': 'Circulating'}, {'cui': 'C0235169', 'cui_str': 'Excitability'}, {'cui': 'C0205178', 'cui_str': 'Acuteness'}]",16.0,0.0498883,HIT-stepper initially showed BDNF responses similar to HIT-treadmill but was no longer significantly different from MCT-treadmill after decreasing the intensity in reaction to two hypotensive events.,"[{'ForeName': 'Pierce', 'Initials': 'P', 'LastName': 'Boyne', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation, Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, College of Allied Health Sciences, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio.'}, {'ForeName': 'Colleen', 'Initials': 'C', 'LastName': 'Meyrose', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation, Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, College of Allied Health Sciences, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jennifer', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Westover', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation, Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, College of Allied Health Sciences, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio.'}, {'ForeName': 'Dustyn', 'Initials': 'D', 'LastName': 'Whitesel', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation, Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, College of Allied Health Sciences, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kristal', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Hatter', 'Affiliation': ""Schubert Research Clinic, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center , Cincinnati, Ohio.""}, {'ForeName': 'Darcy S', 'Initials': 'DS', 'LastName': 'Reisman', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy, College of Health Sciences, University of Delaware , Newark, Delaware.'}, {'ForeName': 'David', 'Initials': 'D', 'LastName': 'Cunningham', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Case Western Reserve University , Cleveland, Ohio.'}, {'ForeName': 'Daniel', 'Initials': 'D', 'LastName': 'Carl', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation, Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, College of Allied Health Sciences, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio.'}, {'ForeName': 'Connor', 'Initials': 'C', 'LastName': 'Jansen', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation, Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, College of Allied Health Sciences, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jane C', 'Initials': 'JC', 'LastName': 'Khoury', 'Affiliation': ""Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center , Cincinnati, Ohio.""}, {'ForeName': 'Myron', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Gerson', 'Affiliation': 'Departments of Internal Medicine and Cardiology, College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati , Cincinnati, Ohio.'}, {'ForeName': 'Brett', 'Initials': 'B', 'LastName': 'Kissela', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati , Cincinnati, Ohio.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kari', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Dunning', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation, Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, College of Allied Health Sciences, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio.'}]","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",['10.1152/japplphysiol.00594.2018']
146,30835911,Recombinant thrombomodulin for acute exacerbation in idiopathic interstitial pneumonias.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE


Acute exacerbation (AE) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP) is a poor prognostic event despite conventional therapy with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhTM) for AE-IIP.
METHODS


For this prospective single-arm open-label multicentre cohort study, we retrospectively registered 61 cases of AE-IIP treated with conventional therapy between 2011 and 2013 (control arm), and prospectively enrolled 39 cases of AE-IIP treated with conventional therapy and rhTM (380 U/kg/day for 6 days) between 2014 and 2016 (rhTM arm). To reduce potential confounding in treatment comparisons, an adjusted mortality analysis for 90-day survival was conducted with weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Weights were derived from propensity scores estimated using a multivariable logistic regression analysis including potential confounders.
RESULTS


The 90-day survival rates of AE-IIP patients treated with/without rhTM were 66.7% (26/39) and 47.5% (29/61), respectively. After adjusting for imbalances, rhTM therapy was significantly associated with reduced mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 0.453; 95% CI: 0.237-0.864; P = 0.0163). The frequencies of adverse events with/without rhTM were 17.9% (7/39) and 19.7% (12/61), which were similar in both arms (P = 1.0). Two bleeding-related adverse events occurred in the rhTM arm.

147,30845363,Changes in physical activity during hospital admission for chronic respiratory disease.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE


Establishing the amount of inpatient physical activity (PA) undertaken by individuals hospitalized for chronic respiratory disease is needed to inform interventions. This observational study investigated whether PA changes when a person is an inpatient, how long is required to obtain representative PA measures and whether PA varies within a day and between patients of differing lengths of stay.
METHODS


A total of 389 participants were recruited as early as possible into their hospitalization. Patients wore a PA monitor from recruitment until discharge. Step count was extracted for a range of wear time criteria. Single-day intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated, with an ICC ≥ 0.80 deemed acceptable.
RESULTS


PA data were available for 259 participants. No changes in daily step count were observed during the inpatient stay (586 (95% CI: 427-744) vs 652 (95% CI: 493-812) steps/day for day 2 and 7, respectively). ICC across all wear time criteria were > 0.80. The most stringent wear time criterion, retaining 80% of the sample, was ≥11 h on ≥1 day. More steps were taken during the morning and afternoon than overnight and evening. After controlling for the Medical Research Council (MRC) grade or oxygen use, there was no difference in step count between patients admitted for 2-3 days (short stay) and those admitted for 7-14 days (long stay).
CONCLUSION


Patients move little during their hospitalization, and inpatient PA did not increase during their stay. A wear time criterion of 11 waking hours on any single day was representative of the entire admission whilst retaining an acceptable proportion of the initial sample size. Patients may need encouragement to move more during their hospital stay.",2019,"After controlling for the Medical Research Council (MRC) grade or oxygen use, there was no difference in step count between patients admitted for 2-3 days (short stay) and those admitted for 7-14 days (long stay).

148,30912296,Regular consumption of green tea improves pulse pressure and induces regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients.,"This study characterized the effects of regular green tea (GT) and hot water (HW) ingestion on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in two equal, sex- and age-matched groups; Grp1 and Grp2 (n = 100 each; age 53 ± 4 years) of hypertensive patients. Grp1 had regular GT treatment, followed by HW ingestion, whereas Grp2 had HW ingestion followed by GT treatment for periods of 4 months each. Electrocardiographic (ECG) and echocardiographic assessments of LVH were made before and at the end of both periods. SBP was lowered significantly by 6.6%; DBP by 5.1%, and PP by 9.1% by the end of month 4 of GT treatment in Grp1. Upon GT cessation and HW ingestion, SBP, DBP, and PP returned to pretreatment levels over 4 months. In Grp2, SBP, DBP, and PP were reduced insignificantly by 1.5%, 1.0%, and 2.3% by the end of the 4th month of HW ingestion. Conversely, over 4 months of GT treatment, SBP, DBP, and PP were significantly lowered by 5.4%, 4.1%, and 7.7% from the baseline values, respectively. ECG and echocardiographic evidence of LVH was shown in 20% of Grp1 and 24% of Grp2 patients before intervention. This was significantly lowered to 8% and 10% in Grp1 and Grp2 by GT treatment.

Females displayed higher aggressive thoughts and aggressive behaviors than males in a nonviolent cartoon condition, while males displayed higher aggressive behaviors than females in a violent cartoon condition. Mediation analysis suggested that the effect on aggressive behaviors was mediated by aggressive thoughts. The findings imply that cartoon developers, parents, and teachers should develop cartoons that inhibit children's aggressive thoughts to avoid aggressive behaviors.

150,32347139,Leukocyte nadir as a predictive factor for efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. Results from the prospective trial SBG 2000-1.,"Background:  Retrospective studies have suggested that chemotherapy-induced leukopenia is associated with improved recurrence-free or overall survival. The SBG 2000-1 trial was designed to verify the favorable prognosis associated with chemotherapy-induced leukopenia in early breast cancer. Patients not experiencing chemotherapy-induced leukopenia were randomized into standard dosed or individually escalated chemotherapy doses based on the grade of leukopenia after a first standard dose. Patients and methods:  1452 women in Sweden and Denmark with operable node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer aged 18-60 years were recruited to participate in this trial. Participants received a first FEC cycle at standard doses (600/60/600 mg/m 2 ). Patients ( n  = 1052) with nadir leukopenia grade 0-2 after the first cycle were randomized between either 6 standard FEC or 6 tailored FEC courses with doses of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide escalated during courses 2 and 3 and thereafter aimed at achieving grade 3 leukopenia. Patients with nadir leukopenia grade 3-4 after the first course continued treatment with standard FEC. Results of the randomized comparison has been published previously. The present study focuses on chemotherapy-induced leukopenia as a covariable with outcome in randomized and non-randomized patients. The prognostic value of leukopenia after course 3, was studied in a Cox model adjusted for cumulative doses of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide. The association of chemotherapy-induced leukopenia with prognosis was a preplanned secondary endpoint for this trial. Results:  The eight-year distant disease-free survival was 73%, 77%, 78% and 83% for patients with leucocyte nadir grade 0, 1, 2 and 3-4, respectively. Higher degree of leukopenia was highly significantly associated to improved distant disease-free survival (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.96,  p  = .008) and overall survival (HR 0.87 (0.76-0.99,  p  = .032).

Nearly half of Kenyan men with HIV-positive partners do not know their partner's status. We carried out a qualitative substudy to explore the experiences of a sample of HIV-positive women when distributing HIV self-tests (HIVST) to their sexual partners.
METHODS


HIV-positive women were invited for in-depth interviews to share their experiences in offering HIVST to their partners and how self-testing impacted their relationships.
RESULTS


Two hundred ninety-seven women were randomized to HIVST, 12 of whom self-reported being HIV positive and 11 participated in the interview. Self-testing procedures and interpretation of results were well understood. Participants were strategic in approaching their partners, thus avoided partner violence. Couple testing was high, which strengthened relationships, improved condom use, and empowered women to make joint decisions concerning their health.
CONCLUSIONS


Giving HIV-positive women HIVST kits to distribute to their male partners is feasible and safe.

This was a preliminary investigation to investigate potential benefits of group yoga, as past work has indicated that one-on-one yoga can improve functional deficits in adults with brain injury.
MATERIALS AND METHODS


Participants served as their own controls. Nine participants with chronic brain injury were recruited, and seven (four female) completed the study. Performance measures of balance and mobility and self-reported measures of balance confidence, pain, and occupational performance and satisfaction were used. Data were collected 3 times: baseline (study onset), pre-yoga (after an 8-week no-contact period), and post-yoga (after 8 weeks of yoga). Group yoga was led by a yoga instructor/occupational therapist, and sessions lasted 1 h and occurred twice a week.
RESULTS


No participants withdrew due to adverse effects from yoga. There were no significant changes between baseline and pre-yoga. Significant improvement was observed post-yoga in balance (p = 0.05), mobility (p = 0.03), and self-reported occupational performance (p = 0.04).

Nurses experience poor quality of life due to workload and role stress. In this study, a spirituality-based intervention was administered to nurse managers.
METHOD


A total of 45 nurse managers participated in the study; 24 were assigned to the experimental group, and 21 were assigned to a control group. The Holy Name Meditation Program was provided solely to the experimental group. Pretest, posttest 1 (5 weeks after the intervention), posttest 2 (12 weeks after the intervention), and posttest 3 (24 weeks after the intervention) data were gathered on seven variables, including spiritual well-being, spiritual needs, job satisfaction, leadership, burnout, depression, and self-efficacy.
RESULTS


The experimental group showed significant improvement in spiritual well-being (p < .001), spiritual needs (p = .029), and job satisfaction (p = .005) until the 24-week follow-up. Burnout (p < .001), depression and anxiety (p = .034), and self-efficacy (p = .024) showed significant improvement until the 12-week follow-up.

The infection of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) has a close association with gastric ulcers and gastric adenocarcinoma. This study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of quadruple regimen with amoxicillin plus berberine vs tetracycline plus furazolidone in H. pylori rescue treatment.
METHODS


We conducted a randomized, open-label, multicenter, noninferiority trial. Subjects with previous treatment failures recruited from 5 centers were randomized (1:1) to accept regimen with esomeprazole and bismuth plus either berberine and amoxicillin (BA group) or tetracycline and furazolidone (TF group) for 14 days. The H. pylori infection status was confirmed at 4-8 weeks after treatment. The eradication rate was the study's primary outcome and trial's secondary outcomes included the rates of symptom improvement, compliance and adverse events. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03609892).
RESULTS


658 subjects were consecutively enrolled in total. ITT analysis demonstrated that the two therapies achieved a similar eradication rate (76.3% vs 77.5%; P = 0.781). PP analysis reached a similar result (81.5% vs 85%; P = 0.278). Difference in the eradication rate achieved by BA quadruple regimen was greater than the preestablished margin of noninferiority, at -10% (the lower bounds of the 95% CI were - 7.66% and - 9.43%, respectively). The rate of adverse events was lower for BA than TF therapy (18.5% vs 26.1%, P = 0.024). The rates of compliance and symptom improvement were similar for the two therapies.

157,32278029,"Addition of Chinese herbal remedy, Tongguan Capsules, to the standard treatment in patients with myocardial infarction improve the ventricular reperfusion and remodeling: Proteomic analysis of possible signaling pathways.","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE


Tongguan Capsules (TGC), a patented Chinese herbal remedy containing Salvia miltiorrhiza, Astragalus membranaceus, Borneolum syntheticum and Grasshopper, has been previously tested in the experimental model of animal hearts subjected to ischemia/reperfusion injury and its cardioprotective effect has been described.
AIM OF THE STUDY


This clinical trial was aimed at investigation whether the administration of TGC to patients suffered myocardial infarction (MI), would diminish dilation of the left ventricular (LV) and reduce development of the adverse clinical consequences.
METHODS


Eligible patients were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to TGC (4.5 g/d for 6 months) superimposed on standard treatment for MI, or the control group receiving the standard protocol alone. The outcomes of this trial were valued after 6 months and reported as a mean change from the baseline in LV end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) and as a frequency of MI recurrence, target-vessel revascularization, severity of heart failure or significant arrhythmia that required the additional therapy within 6 months. In addition, arrays with a panel of specific antibodies were used to assess levels of major cytokines and other pathophysiologic markers, that prompted conclusions about the mechanisms of the ultimate clinical outcomes in both patient's subgroups.
RESULTS


Meaningfully, obtained results indicated that MI patients randomly assigned to the TGC treatment, demonstrated a significant reduction of LVESVI (-4.03 ± 0.73 vs. 1.59 ± 0.43 mL/m 2 , P < 0.001) and a lower incidence of the major adverse cardiovascular events (5.45% vs. 11.44%, P = 0.033). Meaningfully, those patients consistently demonstrated lower serum levels of major inflammatory cytokines, as well as reduced levels of markers of myocardial apoptosis and fibrosis.
CONCLUSION

158,32348009,The Effect of Partial Pulpotomy with iRoot BP Plus in Traumatised Immature Permanent Teeth: A Randomised Prospective Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND/AIM


A new bioceramic material iRoot BP Plus has been introduced and reported to have good biocompatibility, sealing ability and antibacterial activity. It has also been reported to be successfully used for procedures such as pulpotomy, pulp floor perforation repair and so on. However, there are only a few reports on the use of iRoot BP Plus in the management of traumatised teeth with an exposed pulp. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and radiographic outcomes of partial pulpotomy with iRoot BP Plus in immature permanent teeth with complicated crown fracture or complicated crown-root fracture.
MATERIAL AND METHODS


The study was prospectively designed and 110 immature permanent teeth with complicated crown fracture or complicated crown-root fracture were randomly allocated into two groups (n = 55). All teeth were clinically and radiographically assessed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after partial pulpotomy with iRoot BP Plus (experimental group, n=50) or calcium hydroxide (control group,n=49) as the pulp capping agent. Eleven cases were lost during follow-up, and 99 teeth were finally analysed.
RESULTS


There were no intergroup differences in the survival rate, survival time, root length and dentin wall thickness. The calcific bridge was significantly thinner in the iRoot BP Plus group than in the calcium hydroxide group (0.97±0.13mm vs. 1.36±0.12mm; F=5.128, P=0.029).

Blockade of these receptors broadly suppresses type 2 inflammation associated with atopic/allergic diseases, including atopic dermatitis and asthma. Six phase 1 studies investigated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of dupilumab in healthy subjects. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential studies assessed safety and tolerability of single escalating dupilumab doses administered intravenously or subcutaneously (one included various racial groups, and one included exclusively Japanese subjects); 3 randomized, parallel-group, single-dose studies compared the pharmacokinetic profiles of different dupilumab products and formulations after single subcutaneous doses; and one study assessed dupilumab administered as fast versus slow subcutaneous injections. Dupilumab concentrations in serum were measured in all studies, and total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) concentrations were measured in 2 studies as pharmacodynamic markers. Across the phase 1 studies, dupilumab exhibited target-mediated pharmacokinetics consisting of parallel linear and nonlinear elimination, with the target-mediated phase highly dominated by nonlinearity at lower drug concentrations. Systemic exposure and tolerability of dupilumab were consistent irrespective of differences in product, formulation, or racial background. Dupilumab reduced circulating concentrations of total IgE and TARC, indicating blockade of IL-4Rα-mediated signaling.

160,32348038,Comparative biomechanical testing of customized three-dimensional printing acetabular-wing plates for complex acetabular fractures.,"BACKGROUND


Three-dimensional (3D) printing of an acetabular wing-plate is a new minimally invasive surgical technique for complex acetabular fractures.
OBJECTIVES


To investigate the biomechanical stability of 3D printing acetabular wing-plates. The results were compared with 2 conventional fixation systems.
MATERIAL AND METHODS


Eighteen fresh frozen cadaveric pelvises with both column fractures were randomly divided to 3 groups: A - iliosciatic plates fixation system; B - 3D printing plates; C - 2 parallel reconstruction plates fixation system. These constructions were loaded onto a biomechanical testing machine. Longitudinal displacement and stiffness values of the constructs were measured to estimate their stability.
RESULTS


When the load force reached 700 N, Group A was superior to Group B in the longitudinal displacement of point 1 (p > 0.05). The longitudinal displacement of point 2 showed no significant differences among Groups A, B and C, and the displacement of the fracture line over point 3 showed no significant differences between Groups A and B (p > 0.05). The axial stiffness of Groups A, B and C were 122.4800 ±8.8480 N/mm, 168.4830 ±14.8091 N/mm and 83.1300 ±3.8091 N/mm, respectively. Group B was significantly stiffer than A and C (p < 0.05). Loads at failure of internal fixation were 1378.83 ±34.383 N, 1516.83 ±30.896 N and 1351.00 ±26.046 N for Groups A, B and C, respectively. Group B was significantly superior to Groups A and C (p > 0.05).

161,32343614,Hand dexterity assessment in Parkinson's disease: construct validity of the 9-Hole peg test for the more affected hand.,"Purpose:  There is limited understanding of the characteristics and evaluation of more affected hand dexterity loss in Parkinson's disease. We described 9-Hole Peg Test performance for the more affected hand and examined the construct validity of these pegboard scores in mild to severe Parkinson's disease.  Methods:  This observational study analysed baseline data from a cluster-randomised controlled trial.Participants ( n  = 582) completed the pegboard with their more affected hand, the Patient-Specific Index-Parkinson's Disease and Self-assessment Parkinson's Disease Disability Scale. Mean pegboard performance was summarised at each disease stage. To investigate known groups validity, we explored differences in pegboard scores between participants identifying upper limb problems in their 'top three' functional limitations, and those prioritising other limitations. Convergent validity investigated correlations between pegboard performance and self-reported hand function. Results:  Pegboard performance was reduced compared with normative values, and problems with hand activities were reported at each disease stage. Significant differences in pegboard performance between the two functional limitation priority groups ( p  < 0.05), and moderate correlations between pegboard dexterity and hand function (Self-assessment Parkinson's Disease Disability Scale) provided evidence for construct validity. Conclusions:  People with mild to severely disabling Parkinson's disease have reduced dexterity and problems with hand function. Evidence supported the construct validity of 9-Hole Peg Test more affected hand performance.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONPeople with mild to severely disabling PD experience dexterity loss and problems with hand function.It is important for clinicians to assess dexterity and hand function in people with this movement disorder.Evidence supports the construct validity of 9-Hole Peg Test for measuring more affected hand performance in Parkinson's disease.",2020,"Significant differences in pegboard performance between the two functional limitation priority groups ( p  < 0.05), and moderate correlations between pegboard dexterity and hand function (Self-assessment Parkinson's Disease Disability Scale) provided evidence for construct validity.","[""Parkinson's disease"", ""mild to severe Parkinson's disease"", ""People with mild to severely disabling Parkinson's disease""]",[],"[""Patient-Specific Index-Parkinson's Disease and Self-assessment Parkinson's Disease Disability Scale"", ""pegboard dexterity and hand function (Self-assessment Parkinson's Disease Disability Scale"", 'Mean pegboard performance', 'normative values, and problems with hand activities', 'Pegboard performance', '9-Hole Peg Test performance', 'pegboard performance']","[{'cui': 'C0030567', 'cui_str': ""Parkinson's disease""}, {'cui': 'C1513302', 'cui_str': 'Common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 1'}, {'cui': 'C0205082', 'cui_str': 'Severe'}, {'cui': 'C0027361', 'cui_str': 'Person'}]",[],"[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0205369', 'cui_str': 'Specific'}, {'cui': 'C0600653', 'cui_str': 'Indexes'}, {'cui': 'C0030567', 'cui_str': ""Parkinson's disease""}, {'cui': 'C0036591', 'cui_str': 'Self Assessment'}, {'cui': 'C0231170', 'cui_str': 'Disability'}, {'cui': 'C0175659', 'cui_str': 'Scale'}, {'cui': 'C0565699', 'cui_str': 'Ability to perform general manipulative activities'}, {'cui': 'C0562230', 'cui_str': 'Hand functions'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C1273875', 'cui_str': 'Values (community)'}, {'cui': 'C0033213', 'cui_str': 'Problem'}, {'cui': 'C0018563', 'cui_str': 'Hand'}, {'cui': 'C0026606', 'cui_str': 'Physical activity'}, {'cui': 'C0032478', 'cui_str': 'Polyethylene Glycol 400'}, {'cui': 'C0003647', 'cui_str': 'Aptitude Tests'}]",,0.0761873,"Significant differences in pegboard performance between the two functional limitation priority groups ( p  < 0.05), and moderate correlations between pegboard dexterity and hand function (Self-assessment Parkinson's Disease Disability Scale) provided evidence for construct validity.","[{'ForeName': 'Elizabeth', 'Initials': 'E', 'LastName': 'Proud', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physiotherapy, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Meg E', 'Initials': 'ME', 'LastName': 'Morris', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physiotherapy, La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Belinda', 'Initials': 'B', 'LastName': 'Bilney', 'Affiliation': 'School of Allied Health, Australian Catholic University-Ballarat Campus, Ballarat, VIC, Australia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kimberly J', 'Initials': 'KJ', 'LastName': 'Miller', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physiotherapy, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Maarten J', 'Initials': 'MJ', 'LastName': 'Nijkrake', 'Affiliation': 'Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Donders Institiute for Brain, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'ForeName': 'Marten', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Munneke', 'Affiliation': 'Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Donders Institiute for Brain, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jennifer L', 'Initials': 'JL', 'LastName': 'McGinley', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physiotherapy, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.'}]",Disability and rehabilitation,['10.1080/09638288.2020.1754474']

Participants completed two sessions separated by a seven-day washout period, 60 min after consuming 5 mg/kg body mass of caffeine or a placebo. In each session, participants completed as many rounds as possible in 20 min of five pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 air squats. CrossFit ®  performance was the total number of repetitions completed in 20 min. Paired-samples t-tests were used to compare CrossFit ®  performance between caffeine and placebo conditions and to test for a potential learning effect between the first and second sessions. CrossFit ®  performance was not significantly different during the caffeine condition compared to the placebo (468.6 ± 114.7 vs. 466.7 ± 94.3 repetitions,  p  = 0.861). A significant learning effect was identified between the first and second sessions (452.4 ± 101 vs. 483.8 ± 106.5 repetitions,  p  = 0.001), with no significant effect of treatment order ( p  = 0.438).

A design with a baseline measurement and two follow-ups at six and 12 months will be applied. At baseline and the six-month follow-up, patients will complete self-report questionnaires evaluating lifestyle habits and socio-demographic and psychological variables; at the 12-month follow-up, patients will answer a telephone interview assessing lifestyle habits. After the baseline measurement, patients will be randomized into one of three groups: (1) the tailored group, which will receive tailored health brochures; (2) the ""non-tailored"" group, which will receive non-tailored health brochures; or (3) the usual care group, which will receive no print information materials. The effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed through patients' judgments of the brochures and changes in lifestyle. The role of socio-demographic and psychological variables as potential moderators of the materials' effectiveness will be explored. If the TTCYB is efficacious, it will have implications for the design and implementation of tailored communication programs.

166,32340800,Dexmedetomidine versus propofol for prolonged sedation in critically ill trauma and surgical patients.,"BACKGROUND


and Purpose: Currently, dexmedetomidine versus propofol has primarily been studied in medical and cardiac surgery patients with outcomes indicating safe and effective sedation. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of dexmedetomidine versus propofol for prolonged sedation in trauma and surgical patients.
METHODS


This was a single-center prospective study conducted in the Trauma/Surgical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at a Level I academic trauma center. It included patients 18 years of age or older requiring mechanical ventilation who were randomly assigned based on unit bed location to receive either dexmedetomidine or propofol. The primary outcome was duration of mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes included mortality; proportion of time in target sedation; incidence of delirium, hypotension, and bradycardia; and ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS).
RESULTS


A total of 57 patients were included. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. There was no significant difference in duration of mechanical ventilation (median [IQR]) between the dexmedetomidine (78.5[125] hours) and propofol (105[130] hours; p = 0.15) groups. There was no difference between groups in ICU mortality, ICU and hospital LOS, or incidence of delirium. Safety outcomes were also similar. Patients in the dexmedetomidine group spent a significantly greater percentage of time in target sedation (98[8] %) compared to propofol group (92[10] %; p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS


Our results suggest that, similar to medical and cardiac surgery patients, dexmedetomidine and propofol are safe and effective sedation agents in critically ill trauma and surgical patients; however, dexmedetomidine achieves target sedation better than propofol for this specific population.",2020,"There was no difference between groups in ICU mortality, ICU and hospital LOS, or incidence of delirium.","['Trauma/Surgical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at a Level', 'critically ill trauma and surgical patients', 'A total of 57 patients were included', 'trauma and surgical patients', 'patients 18 years of age or older requiring mechanical ventilation', 'medical and cardiac surgery patients with outcomes indicating safe and effective sedation']","['dexmedetomidine and propofol', 'Dexmedetomidine', 'dexmedetomidine or propofol', 'propofol', 'dexmedetomidine']","['mortality; proportion of time in target sedation; incidence of delirium, hypotension, and bradycardia; and ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS', 'percentage of time in target sedation', 'duration of mechanical ventilation', 'duration of mechanical ventilation (median [IQR', 'ICU mortality, ICU and hospital LOS, or incidence of delirium']","[{'cui': 'C0043251', 'cui_str': 'Injuries, Wounds'}, {'cui': 'C1690590', 'cui_str': 'Surgical intensive care unit'}, {'cui': 'C0021708', 'cui_str': 'Intensive care unit'}, {'cui': 'C0441889', 'cui_str': 'Levels'}, {'cui': 'C0010340', 'cui_str': 'Critical illness'}, {'cui': 'C0543467', 'cui_str': 'Surgery'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0439810', 'cui_str': 'Total'}, {'cui': 'C0332257', 'cui_str': 'Including'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0580836', 'cui_str': 'Old'}, {'cui': 'C0199470', 'cui_str': 'Mechanical ventilation'}, {'cui': 'C0199168', 'cui_str': 'Medical service'}, {'cui': 'C0018821', 'cui_str': 'Operation on heart'}, {'cui': 'C1274040', 'cui_str': 'Result'}, {'cui': 'C1444656', 'cui_str': 'Indicated'}, {'cui': 'C1280519', 'cui_str': 'Effectiveness'}, {'cui': 'C0235195', 'cui_str': 'Sedated'}]","[{'cui': 'C0113293', 'cui_str': 'Dexmedetomidine'}, {'cui': 'C0033487', 'cui_str': 'Propofol'}]","[{'cui': 'C0026565', 'cui_str': 'Mortality rate'}, {'cui': 'C0040223', 'cui_str': 'Time'}, {'cui': 'C0235195', 'cui_str': 'Sedated'}, {'cui': 'C0021149', 'cui_str': 'Incidence'}, {'cui': 'C0011206', 'cui_str': 'Delirium'}, {'cui': 'C0020649', 'cui_str': 'Low blood pressure'}, {'cui': 'C0428977', 'cui_str': 'Bradycardia'}, {'cui': 'C0021708', 'cui_str': 'Intensive care unit'}, {'cui': 'C0023303', 'cui_str': 'Length of Stay'}, {'cui': 'C0439165', 'cui_str': 'Percent'}, {'cui': 'C0449238', 'cui_str': 'Duration'}, {'cui': 'C0199470', 'cui_str': 'Mechanical ventilation'}, {'cui': 'C0549183', 'cui_str': 'Midline'}]",57.0,0.120897,"There was no difference between groups in ICU mortality, ICU and hospital LOS, or incidence of delirium.","[{'ForeName': 'Natalie A', 'Initials': 'NA', 'LastName': 'Winings', 'Affiliation': '1924 Alcoa Highway, Box 41, Department of Pharmacy, The University of Tennessee Medical Center Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920 USA.

167,32340820,Efficacy of ketamine for initial control of acute agitation in the emergency department: A randomized study.,"BACKGROUND


Clinicians often encounter agitated patients, and current treatment options include benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. Ketamine rapidly induces dissociation, maintains cardiovascular stability, spontaneous respirations, and airway reflexes. There are no prospective, randomized studies comparing ketamine to other agents in the initial management of acute agitation in the Emergency Department (ED).
OBJECTIVE


Determine the efficacy and safety of ketamine compared to parenteral haloperidol plus lorazepam for initial control of acute agitation.
METHODS


This study was a prospective, single-institution, randomized, open-label, real world, standard of care pilot study. Adult patients with combative agitation were randomized to ketamine (4 mg/kg IM or 1 mg/kg IV) or haloperidol/lorazepam (haloperidol 5-10 mg IM or IV + lorazepam 1-2 mg IM or IV). The primary outcome was sedation within 5 min, and secondary outcomes included sedation within 15 min, time to sedation, and safety.
RESULTS


Ninety three patients were enrolled from January 15, 2018 to October 10, 2018. Significantly more patients who received ketamine compared to haloperidol/lorazepam were sedated within 5 min (22% vs 0%, p = 0.001) and 15 min (66% vs 7%, p < 0.001). The median time to sedation in patients who received ketamine compared to haloperidol/lorazepam was 15 vs 36 min respectively (p < 0.001).

Forty patients who were clinically diagnosed with plantar fasciitis were included in the study. The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. The ESWT-DN group was applied 3 sessions of ESWT to plantar fascia and DN to the trigger points in the gastrosoleus muscles. The ESWT group was applied only ESWT treatment to plantar fascia. We used visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and a pressure algometer for pressure pain threshold. The functionality of the patients was evaluated with Foot Function Index (FFI). Also, maximum painless standing time and maximum painless walking distance were recorded. All assessments were repeated twice; first, pretreatment and second 1 month after the treatment. In both groups, there were statistically significant improvements in VAS, pressure pain threshold, maximum painless standing time, maximum painless walking distance, and FFI's pain, disability, and activity limitation subscales scores (p ≤ .001). In intergroup comparison; it was showed that VAS scores, maximum painless standing time (p = .002), maximum painless walking distance (p ≤ .001), and FFI pain subscale scores (p = .034) were statistically superior in the ESWT-DN group. There was no statistically difference between the groups in pressure pain threshold (p = .132), FFI disability (p = .081), and FFI activity limitation subscale (p = .226) scores.

Sodium glucose transport inhibitors (SGLT2i) can reduce risk of heart failure (HF) and cardiovascular death in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and existing cardiovascular disease. Our aim was to examine the effect of the SGLT2i dapagliflozin on cardiac function in people with T2D and albuminuria.
METHODS


A secondary analysis of a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study of 12 weeks treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg versus placebo. Myocardial function was assessed by echocardiography and biomarkers of cardiac risk were measured. An exploratory diastolic composite of echocardiographic variables was computed.
RESULTS


Of the 36 participants completing the study 89% were male, mean age 64 ± 8 years, diabetes duration 16.4 ± 4.7 years and HbA 1c  73 ± 15 mmol/mol (8.9 ± 1.4%), 30.6% had former cardiovascular events and 32% had macroalbuminuria. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 55.4% after placebo and 54.3% after dapagliflozin (p = 0.15), global longitudinal strain -16.1 vs. -15.9, (p = 0.64), E/e' 7.6 vs. 7.6 (p = 0.082), and tissue Doppler velocity e' 10.0 vs. 10.6 (p = 0.05). The composite score showed diastolic function improvement of 19.8% (p = 0.021). No other significant changes were observed.

170,32341113,"Minimal clinically important differences in average, best, worst and current intensity and unpleasantness of chronic breathlessness.","BACKGROUND


Chronic breathlessness has devastating consequences. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for  current intensity  has been estimated as 9 mm on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). We aimed to determine MCIDs for commonly used dimensions and recall periods: the  current unpleasantness  and  current ,  average ,  best  and  worst intensity  of the last 24 h for chronic breathlessness.
METHODS


This was a secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial of morphine  versus  placebo during seven days in people with chronic breathlessness from severe disease. The breathlessness scores were self-reported using a diary each evening on 100 mm VAS. The MCID for improvement in each score was estimated using anchor based and distribution based methods.
RESULTS


283 participants (mean age 74.2 years; 63% males; 58% COPD; 87.0% mMRC 3-4) were included. Anchor-based MCIDs for breathlessness scores ranged from -13.9 mm to -9.5 mm. The MCIDs were similar when using different anchors and across all participants, and participants with more severe BREATHLESSNESS (mMRC 3-4), respectively. Distribution based effect sizes were: small (-4.7 to -6.3 mm), moderate (-9.4 to -12.5 mm) and large effect (-15.0 to -20.0 mm). Sample sizes for trials using the different scores were proposed. MCIDs of absolute change were more stable than using relative change from baseline.
CONCLUSION


An improvement of about 10 mm on a 100 mm VAS is likely to be clinically meaningful across commonly used measures of chronic breathlessness ( current intensity, unpleasantness , and  average ,  best  and  worst  intensity over the last 24 h) - to evaluate clinical benefit and effects in therapeutic trials.",2020,"The MCIDs were similar when using different anchors and across all participants, and participants with more severe BREATHLESSNESS (mMRC 3-4), respectively.","['283 participants (mean age 74.2\u2005years; 63% males; 58% COPD; 87.0', 'people with chronic breathlessness from severe disease']",['morphine  versus  placebo'],"['average, best, worst and current intensity and unpleasantness of chronic breathlessness', 'breathlessness scores']","[{'cui': 'C4708786', 'cui_str': '283'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0086582', 'cui_str': 'Male'}, {'cui': 'C0024117', 'cui_str': 'Chronic obstructive lung disease'}, {'cui': 'C0027361', 'cui_str': 'Person'}, {'cui': 'C0205191', 'cui_str': 'Chronic'}, {'cui': 'C0013404', 'cui_str': 'Dyspnea'}, {'cui': 'C0205082', 'cui_str': 'Severe'}, {'cui': 'C0012634', 'cui_str': 'Disease'}]","[{'cui': 'C0026549', 'cui_str': 'Morphine'}, {'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}]","[{'cui': 'C0038848', 'cui_str': 'Supplies'}, {'cui': 'C0053267', 'cui_str': ""benzoylamido-4'-aminostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate""}, {'cui': 'C0521116', 'cui_str': 'Current'}, {'cui': 'C0522510', 'cui_str': 'With intensity'}, {'cui': 'C0205191', 'cui_str': 'Chronic'}, {'cui': 'C0013404', 'cui_str': 'Dyspnea'}, {'cui': 'C0449820', 'cui_str': 'Score'}]",4.0,0.214139,"The MCIDs were similar when using different anchors and across all participants, and participants with more severe BREATHLESSNESS (mMRC 3-4), respectively.","[{'ForeName': 'Magnus', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Ekström', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Division of Respiratory Medicine & Allergology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden pmekstrom@gmail.com.'}, {'ForeName': 'Miriam J', 'Initials': 'MJ', 'LastName': 'Johnson', 'Affiliation': 'Wolfson Palliative Care Research Centre, Hull York Medical School, University of Hull, UK.'}, {'ForeName': 'Chao', 'Initials': 'C', 'LastName': 'Huang', 'Affiliation': 'Wolfson Palliative Care Research Centre, Hull York Medical School, University of Hull, UK.'}, {'ForeName': 'David C', 'Initials': 'DC', 'LastName': 'Currow', 'Affiliation': 'IMPACCT, Faculty of Health, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, New South Wales, Australia.'}]",The European respiratory journal,['10.1183/13993003.02202-2019']
171,32341121,Dopamine and risky decision-making in gambling disorder.,"Gambling disorder is a behavioral addiction associated with impairments in value-based decision-making and cognitive control. These functions are thought to be regulated by dopamine within fronto-striatal circuits, but the role of altered dopamine neurotransmission in the etiology of gambling disorder remains controversial. Preliminary evidence suggests that increasing frontal dopamine tone might improve cognitive functioning in gambling disorder. We therefore examined whether increasing frontal dopamine tone via a single dose of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor tolcapone would reduce risky choice in human gamblers (n=14) in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study. Data were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation and a combined risky choice drift diffusion model. Model comparison revealed a non-linear mapping from value differences to trial-wise drift rates, confirming recent findings. An increase in risk-taking under tolcapone vs. placebo was about five times more likely, given the data, than a decrease (BF = 0.2). Examination of drug effects on diffusion model parameters revealed that an increase in the value-dependency of the drift rate under tolcapone was about thirteen times more likely than a decrease (BF = .073). In contrast, a reduction in the maximum drift rate under tolcapone was about seven times more likely than an increase (BF = 7.51). Results add to previous work on COMT inhibitors in behavioral addictions and to mounting evidence for the applicability of diffusion models in value-based decision-making. Future work should focus on individual genetic, clinical and cognitive factors that might account for heterogeneity in the effects of COMT inhibition. Significance statement  Gambling disorder is associated with impairments in value-based decision-making and cognitive control, functions regulated by the neurotransmitter dopamine. Here we examined whether increasing frontal dopamine tone via the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor tolcapone would reduce risky choice in a group of gamblers. Computational modeling did not reveal consistent reductions in risky decision-making under tolcapone in gamblers. If anything, tolcapone increased risky choice. Future work should focus on individual genetic, clinical and cognitive factors that might account for heterogeneity in the effects of COMT inhibition.",2020,"Gambling disorder is associated with impairments in value-based decision-making and cognitive control, functions regulated by the neurotransmitter dopamine.","['gambling disorder', 'human gamblers (n=14']","['catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor tolcapone', 'Dopamine', 'frontal dopamine tone via the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor tolcapone', 'tolcapone vs. placebo', 'tolcapone', 'placebo']","['maximum drift rate under tolcapone', 'risky choice', 'value-dependency of the drift rate under tolcapone', 'cognitive functioning']","[{'cui': 'C0016995', 'cui_str': 'Gambling'}, {'cui': 'C0012634', 'cui_str': 'Disease'}, {'cui': 'C0086418', 'cui_str': 'Homo sapiens'}, {'cui': 'C0858352', 'cui_str': 'Gambler'}]","[{'cui': 'C0007407', 'cui_str': 'Catechol methyltransferase'}, {'cui': 'C0243077', 'cui_str': 'inhibitors'}, {'cui': 'C0246330', 'cui_str': 'tolcapone'}, {'cui': 'C0013030', 'cui_str': 'Dopamine'}, {'cui': 'C0205123', 'cui_str': 'Coronal'}, {'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}]","[{'cui': 'C0806909', 'cui_str': 'Max'}, {'cui': 'C0246330', 'cui_str': 'tolcapone'}, {'cui': 'C0008300', 'cui_str': 'Choice Behavior'}, {'cui': 'C1273875', 'cui_str': 'Values (community)'}, {'cui': 'C0011546', 'cui_str': 'Dependency, Psychology'}, {'cui': 'C0392334', 'cui_str': 'Ability to perform cognitive activity'}]",,0.0953733,"Gambling disorder is associated with impairments in value-based decision-making and cognitive control, functions regulated by the neurotransmitter dopamine.","[{'ForeName': 'Jan', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Peters', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Biological Psychology, University of Cologne, German jan.peters@uni-koeln.de.'}, {'ForeName': 'Taylor', 'Initials': 'T', 'LastName': 'Vega', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, VA Northern California Healthcare System, United States.'}, {'ForeName': 'Dawn', 'Initials': 'D', 'LastName': 'Weinstein', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco, United States.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jennifer', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Mitchell', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco, United States.'}, {'ForeName': 'Andrew', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Kayser', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, VA Northern California Healthcare System, United States.'}]",eNeuro,['10.1523/ENEURO.0461-19.2020']

WASO and LPS were dose-dependently reduced from baseline to days 1 and 2 after daridorexant administration (multiple comparison procedure modeling,  p  < 0.0001 and  p  = 0.004, respectively); reductions were statistically significant for doses ≥10 mg compared with placebo (WASO: -32.0, -45.1, -61.4 minutes; LPS: -44.9, -43.8, -45.4 minutes for 10, 25, and 50 mg, respectively,  p  ≤ 0.025). Treatment-emergent adverse events were similar for daridorexant and placebo; the most frequent were fatigue, nasopharyngitis, gait disturbance, and headache (≤7% in any group).
CONCLUSIONS


Daridorexant was well tolerated. Dose-dependent improvements in WASO and LPS were statistically significant (dose range 10-50 mg) in elderly people with insomnia disorder.

173,32341237,Comparison of the Efficacy of Polaprezinc Plus Proton Pump Inhibitor and Rebamipide Plus Proton Pump Inhibitor Treatments for Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection-induced Ulcers.,"GOALS


We assessed the efficacy of polaprezinc plus proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD)-induced ulcer healing compared with rebamipide plus PPI treatment.
BACKGROUND


ESD has been widely used as a local treatment option that cures gastric neoplasms. However, it causes large and deep artificial ulcers, and there are no guidelines with regard to the optimal treatment durations and drug regimens for ESD-induced ulcers. Polaprezinc is effective for promoting ulcer healing and helps enhance the quality of ulcer healing.
STUDY


Two hundred ten patients with ESD-induced ulcers were randomly allocated to treatment with polaprezinc (150 mg/d) plus pantoprazole (40 mg/d) or treatment with rebamipide (300 mg/d) plus pantoprazole (40 mg/d). We evaluated the ulcer healing rate and condition of the ulcer at 4 weeks after dissection. The χ or Fisher exact test and the Student t test were used.
RESULTS


The ulcer healing rates at 4 weeks after dissection in the polaprezinc plus pantoprazole treatment group were not inferior compared with those in the rebamipide plus pantoprazole treatment group, both in the intention-to-treat analysis (90.3% and 91.4%, respectively, P=0.523) and per-protocol analysis (89.9% and 91.1%, respectively, P=0.531). The short procedure time was an independent predictive factor for a high ulcer healing rate (odds ratio: 0.975; 95% confidence interval: 0.958-0.993; P=0.006).
CONCLUSION


The polaprezinc plus PPI treatment showed noninferiority to rebamipide plus PPI treatment in the ulcer healing rate at 4 weeks after ESD.",2020,"The short procedure time was an independent predictive factor for a high ulcer healing rate (odds ratio: 0.975; 95% confidence interval: 0.958-0.993; P=0.006).

174,32341356,Impact of Vitamin E supplementation on vascular function in haptoglobin genotype stratified diabetes patients (EVAS Trial): a randomised controlled trial.,"AIMS


Vitamin E (Vit-E) may preferentially improve cardiovascular risk in haptoglobin 2-2 (Hp2-2) genotype diabetes individuals. We studied the impact of Vit-E supplementation on vascular function in diabetes individuals stratified by haptoglobin genotype in Singapore.
METHODS


In this 24-week, double blind, placebo-controlled RCT, we recruited 187 subjects (101 Hp2-2, 86 non-Hp2-2).
INTERVENTION


alpha-tocopherol-400 IU.
PRIMARY OUTCOME


Change in EndoPAT-derived reactive-hyperaemia index (RHI) and augmentation index (AIx); Secondary Outcomes: Pulse-Wave velocity (Sphygmocor-PWV), carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), inflammation (hsCRP), derivatives of reactive-oxygen metabolites (dROMs), biological antioxidant-potential (BAPs), HbA1c, LDL-C, HDL-C and oxidised LDL-C (ox-LDL).
RESULTS


Overall, with Vit-E supplementation no significant change in RHI, PWV, CIMT, hsCRP, dROMS, BAPs, HDL-C and HbA1c was observed (p > 0.05); an increase in LDL-C with concomitant decrease in ox-LDL, and incidentally increase in eGFR was observed (p < 0.05). No interaction effect with haptoglobin genotype was seen for all outcomes (p > 0.05). Subgroup analysis: In the non-Hp-2-2 group, Vit-E supplementation led to a higher EndoPAT-derived AIx, accompanied by higher LDL and ox-LDL concentrations (p < 0.05); Hp2-2 group: Vit-E supplementation led to higher eGFR when compared to the non-Hp2-2 group (exploratory) (p < 0.05). We observed an interaction effect for baseline haptoglobin concentration (threshold > 119 mg/dl) with intervention in terms of increased EndoPAT-derived AIx in the Hp > 119 mg/dl group whereas no change in the group with Hp ≤ 119 mg/dl.
CONCLUSION


Vit-E supplementation did not show any preferential benefit or deleterious effect on vascular function in Hp2-2 diabetes subjects in Singapore. A possible deleterious effect of an increase in arterial stiffness in individuals with Hp > 119 mg/dl was observed. Future studies should consider personalisation based on baseline Hp concentrations in patients with T2DM rather than just Hp2-2 genotype to evaluate impact on the detailed lipid pathways, cardiac and renal physiology. The impact of ethnic differences needs to be explored in greater details.",2020,"Subgroup analysis: In the non-Hp-2-2 group, Vit-E supplementation led to a higher EndoPAT-derived AIx, accompanied by higher LDL and ox-LDL concentrations (p < 0.05); Hp2-2 group: Vit-E supplementation led to higher eGFR when compared to the non-Hp2-2 group (exploratory) (p < 0.05).","['haptoglobin 2-2 (Hp2-2) genotype diabetes individuals', 'diabetes individuals stratified by haptoglobin genotype in Singapore', 'individuals with Hp\u2009>\u2009119\u2009mg/dl was observed', 'Hp2-2 diabetes subjects in Singapore', '187 subjects (101 Hp2-2, 86 non-Hp2-2', 'haptoglobin genotype stratified diabetes patients (EVAS Trial']","['Vitamin E (Vit-E', 'Vit-E supplementation', 'placebo-controlled RCT', 'Vitamin E supplementation']","['LDL-C', 'cardiovascular risk', 'Change in EndoPAT-derived reactive-hyperaemia index (RHI) and augmentation index (AIx', 'arterial stiffness', 'eGFR', 'Pulse-Wave velocity (Sphygmocor-PWV), carotid intima media thickness (CIMT), inflammation (hsCRP), derivatives of reactive-oxygen metabolites (dROMs), biological antioxidant-potential (BAPs), HbA1c, LDL-C, HDL-C and oxidised LDL-C (ox-LDL', 'LDL and ox-LDL concentrations', 'RHI, PWV, CIMT, hsCRP, dROMS, BAPs, HDL-C and HbA1c', 'vascular function', 'baseline haptoglobin concentration']","[{'cui': 'C0301687', 'cui_str': 'Haptoglobin 2-2'}, {'cui': 'C0017431', 'cui_str': 'Genotype'}, {'cui': 'C0011849', 'cui_str': 'Diabetes mellitus'}, {'cui': 'C0027361', 'cui_str': 'Person'}, {'cui': 'C0205363', 'cui_str': 'Stratified'}, {'cui': 'C0018595', 'cui_str': 'Haptoglobin'}, {'cui': 'C0037173', 'cui_str': 'Singapore'}, {'cui': 'C0439269', 'cui_str': 'mg/dL'}, {'cui': 'C4517618', 'cui_str': '187'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0008976', 'cui_str': 'Clinical trial'}]","[{'cui': 'C0042874', 'cui_str': 'Vitamin E'}, {'cui': 'C4524012', 'cui_str': 'Vitamin E supplementation'}, {'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}, {'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}]","[{'cui': 'C0023169', 'cui_str': 'LDL(1)'}, {'cui': 'C4324389', 'cui_str': 'Cardiovascular risk'}, {'cui': 'C0392747', 'cui_str': 'Changing'}, {'cui': 'C0205332', 'cui_str': 'Reactive'}, {'cui': 'C0020452', 'cui_str': 'Hyperemia'}, {'cui': 'C0600653', 'cui_str': 'Indexes'}, {'cui': 'C0332509', 'cui_str': 'Increased size'}, {'cui': 'C0599949', 'cui_str': 'Arterial stiffness'}, {'cui': 'C0034802', 'cui_str': 'Epidermal growth factor-urogastrone receptor'}, {'cui': 'C3494431', 'cui_str': 'Pulse Wave Velocity'}, {'cui': 'C0162864', 'cui_str': 'Tunica intima'}, {'cui': 'C0009458', 'cui_str': 'Communications Media'}, {'cui': 'C1280412', 'cui_str': 'Thick'}, {'cui': 'C0021368', 'cui_str': 'Inflammation'}, {'cui': 'C0243072', 'cui_str': 'derivatives'}, {'cui': 'C0030054', 'cui_str': 'Oxygen'}, {'cui': 'C0870883', 'cui_str': 'Metabolite'}, {'cui': 'C4049351', 'cui_str': 'Biological antioxidant potential'}, {'cui': 'C0019018', 'cui_str': 'Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated'}, {'cui': 'C0023821', 'cui_str': 'High density lipoprotein'}, {'cui': 'C3539166', 'cui_str': 'Oxidised low density lipoprotein'}, {'cui': 'C0004268', 'cui_str': 'Attention'}, {'cui': 'C0047830', 'cui_str': ""4,4'-thiodianiline""}, {'cui': 'C0232337', 'cui_str': 'Vascular function'}, {'cui': 'C0168634', 'cui_str': 'BaseLine dental cement'}, {'cui': 'C0018595', 'cui_str': 'Haptoglobin'}]",187.0,0.209668,"Subgroup analysis: In the non-Hp-2-2 group, Vit-E supplementation led to a higher EndoPAT-derived AIx, accompanied by higher LDL and ox-LDL concentrations (p < 0.05); Hp2-2 group: Vit-E supplementation led to higher eGFR when compared to the non-Hp2-2 group (exploratory) (p < 0.05).","[{'ForeName': 'Rinkoo', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Dalan', 'Affiliation': 'Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.

175,32341486,Impact of a sodium-reduced bread intervention with and without dietary counseling on sodium intake-a cluster randomized controlled trial among Danish families.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES


Excessive intake of sodium is a dietary risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Currently, intake of sodium is much higher than the recommended level in most western countries, and effective strategies to reduce population sodium intake are lacking. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of two different sodium reduction strategies on the intake of sodium, potassium, and the sodium to potassium ratio among Danish families SUBJECTS/METHODS: The study was a 4-month, single-blinded, cluster randomized controlled trial with a parallel design. Eighty-nine healthy Danish families, with a minimum of one child and one parent (n = 309), were randomly assigned to receive sodium-reduced bread (Intervention A), sodium-reduced bread and dietary counseling (Intervention B) or regular sodium bread (Control). The primary outcome was change in daily sodium intake, measured by 24-h urinary sodium excretion. Secondary outcomes included changes in dietary potassium and the sodium to potassium ratio.
RESULTS


No significant differences in daily sodium intake were observed in the two intervention groups compared with the control. When analyzing the results separately for children and adults, a reduction in dietary sodium of 0.6 g/day (-1.0, -0.2), p = 0.005 occurred among adults in intervention B compared with control.
CONCLUSIONS


This study demonstrates that providing sodium-reduced bread in combination with dietary counseling is an effective strategy to reduce dietary sodium among adults, but the effect is lacking in children. The study was not able to show significant effects when providing sodium-reduced bread alone in neither adults nor children.",2020,No significant differences in daily sodium intake were observed in the two intervention groups compared with the control.,"['Eighty-nine healthy Danish families, with a minimum of one child and one parent (n\u2009=\u2009309', 'Danish families']","['sodium-reduced bread (Intervention A), sodium-reduced bread and dietary counseling (Intervention B) or regular sodium bread (Control', 'sodium-reduced bread in combination with dietary counseling', 'sodium-reduced bread intervention with and without dietary counseling']","['changes in dietary potassium and the sodium to potassium ratio', 'change in daily sodium intake, measured by 24-h urinary sodium excretion', 'daily sodium intake']","[{'cui': 'C3816958', 'cui_str': '80'}, {'cui': 'C0010969', 'cui_str': 'Danish language'}, {'cui': 'C0015576', 'cui_str': 'Family'}, {'cui': 'C0008059', 'cui_str': 'Child'}, {'cui': 'C0030551', 'cui_str': 'Parent'}]","[{'cui': 'C0037473', 'cui_str': 'Sodium'}, {'cui': 'C0392756', 'cui_str': 'Reduced'}, {'cui': 'C0006138', 'cui_str': 'Bread'}, {'cui': 'C0184661', 'cui_str': 'Procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0012155', 'cui_str': 'Dietary finding'}, {'cui': 'C0010210', 'cui_str': 'Counseling'}, {'cui': 'C0205272', 'cui_str': 'Regular'}]","[{'cui': 'C0392747', 'cui_str': 'Changing'}, {'cui': 'C0162800', 'cui_str': 'Dietary Potassium'}, {'cui': 'C0037473', 'cui_str': 'Sodium'}, {'cui': 'C0032821', 'cui_str': 'Potassium'}, {'cui': 'C0456603', 'cui_str': 'Ratio'}, {'cui': 'C0332173', 'cui_str': 'Daily'}, {'cui': 'C3251814', 'cui_str': 'Measurement of fluid intake'}, {'cui': 'C0079809', 'cui_str': 'Measure'}, {'cui': 'C0221102', 'cui_str': 'Excretory function'}]",89.0,0.0451107,No significant differences in daily sodium intake were observed in the two intervention groups compared with the control.,"[{'ForeName': 'Nanna Louise', 'Initials': 'NL', 'LastName': 'Riis', 'Affiliation': 'National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark, Kemitorvet, Building 201, 2800, Kgs.

We randomly assigned, in a 1 : 1 ratio, 20 women who had undergone surgery for early breast cancer to a group that discussed adjuvant treatment with their physicians using the ChemoCalc software (ChemoCalc group) or a group that discussed adjuvant treatment without ChemoCalc (Usual Explanation group). The participants completed a five-grade evaluation questionnaire after these discussions.

178,32343967,Peak Inspiratory Flows: Defining Repeatability Limits and a Predictive Equation for Different Inhalers.,"BACKGROUND


Peak inspiratory flow (PIF) has been proposed as a measure to assess a patient's ability to use dry powder inhalers (DPI). However, robust quality criteria to determine a repeatability limit for measuring PIF are lacking.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS


What are the repeatability limits for measuring PIF? What is the relationship between PIF measured using the In-Check™ DIAL device at Diskus® (PIF D ) and HandiHaler® (PIF HH ) resistances?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS


Data from a randomized, controlled, phase 3 trial (study 0149) was used to define repeatability limits for PIF. Additionally, a model to characterize the relationship between PIF measured using the In-Check DIAL device at PIF D  and PIF HH  was defined using data from two randomized, controlled, phase 3 trials (studies 0128 and 0149).
RESULTS


In study 0128, the mean values (standard deviation [SD]) for PIF at zero resistance and PIF HH  were 84.6 (33.4) and 57.3 (26.1) L/min, respectively. In study 0149, the mean values (SD) for PIF D  and PIF HH  were 42.4 (11.2) and 29.0 (8.3) L/min, respectively. At the mean level, the mean difference between measurement attempts for PIF D  and PIF HH  was small, < 5 L/min and < 3 L/min, respectively. The repeatability limit was determined as 10 and 5 L/min for PIF D  and PIF HH , respectively. Modeling the relationship between PIF D  and PIF HH , after controlling for significant covariates demonstrated that a PIF D  value of 60 L/min was approximately equivalent to PIF HH  of 40 L/min.
INTERPRETATIONS


This analysis demonstrated that the two highest values of PIF using the In-Check DIAL device among three inspiratory efforts met the repeatability limit. Altogether, these data provide guidance for measuring PIF against the simulated resistance of a specific DPI in clinical practice and research studies.",2020,"At the mean level, the mean difference between measurement attempts for PIF D  and PIF HH  was small, < 5 L/min and < 3 L/min, respectively.",[],['Peak inspiratory flow (PIF'],"['repeatability limit', 'mean values (standard deviation [SD]) for PIF at zero resistance and PIF HH', 'mean values (SD) for PIF D  and PIF HH', 'PIF D  and PIF HH']",[],"[{'cui': 'C0429742', 'cui_str': 'Peak inspiratory flow rate'}]","[{'cui': 'C0439801', 'cui_str': 'Limited'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C1273875', 'cui_str': 'Values (community)'}, {'cui': 'C0871420', 'cui_str': 'Standard deviation'}, {'cui': 'C0429742', 'cui_str': 'Peak inspiratory flow rate'}, {'cui': 'C0919414', 'cui_str': '0'}, {'cui': 'C0162535', 'cui_str': 'Electrical Resistance'}]",,0.0420994,"At the mean level, the mean difference between measurement attempts for PIF D  and PIF HH  was small, < 5 L/min and < 3 L/min, respectively.","[{'ForeName': 'Chris N', 'Initials': 'CN', 'LastName': 'Barnes', 'Affiliation': 'From Theravance Biopharma US, Inc.

Physiological adaptations of stroke patients after high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE


This study determined the HIIT and MICT effects on aerobic capacity, cerebral oxygenation, peak cardiac output (CO), and serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in stroke patients.
METHODS


We included 23 stroke patients with age about 55 years and stroke duration > 24 months; participants completed 36 sessions of exercise training for 30 min; 13 were randomly assigned to perform MICT at 60% of peak oxygen consumption (VO 2peak ) and 10 to perform HIIT at alternating 80% (3 min) and 40% (3 min) VO 2peak . Before and after interventions, we evaluated VO 2peak , peak CO, arteriovenous oxygen difference (AV O 2diff ), bilateral frontal cortex oxygenation (relative changes of oxyhemoglobin Δ[O 2 Hb], deoxyhemoglobin Δ[HHb], and total hemoglobin Δ[THb] levels), serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level, and fluorescent cell staining for neuron morphology and percentage of cell-bearing neurites (% neurites).
RESULTS


HIIT induced significant increases in VO 2peak  (p=0.008), CO (p=0.038), Δ[HHb] (p=0.046), Δ[THb] (p=0.046), and serum BDNF level (p=0.012). The improvement in VO 2peak  was significantly greater with HIIT than MICT (20.7% vs 9.8%, p=0.031), as was AV O 2diff  (p=0.041), Δ[HHb] (p=0.027), and serum BDNF level (p< 0.001). HIIT facilitated neuron dendritic protrusions (greater % neurites, p=0.012) with prominent redistribution of mitochondria.
CONCLUSION


As compared with MICT, HIIT improved aerobic capacity by increasing systemic tissue O 2  extraction in stroke patients. Increased cerebral O 2  utilization in the involved hemisphere was also identified after HIIT. These physiological adaptations may be associated with increased serum BDNF level.

We randomly assigned 26 participants to either control (sham stimulation) or nGVS groups. All participants were measured for COP sway while standing with open eyes at baseline, during stimulation, and after stimulation. In the nGVS group, sway path length, mediolateral mean velocity, and anteroposterior mean velocity decreased both during stimulation and after stimulation compared with baseline.

182,32344133,Unilateral or bilateral percutaneous endoscopic debridement and lavage treatment for lumbar spinal tuberculosis.,"AIM


To compare the clinical outcome between bilateral percutaneous endoscopic debridement and lavage (PEDL) and unilateral PEDL treatment for lumbar spine tuberculosis (LST).
METHODS


A total of 40 patients with LST who underwent either bilateral PEDL (group A) or unilateral PEDL (group B) were reviewed. Perioperative parameters were assessed by operative time, intraoperative fluoroscopy times, and days of postoperative continuous irrigation and vacuum drainage. Clinical outcomes were evaluated in the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), visual analog scale (VAS), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein(CRP). All patients were followed up for at least 18 months after treatment.
RESULTS


The average operative time and the intraoperative fluoroscopy times were increased in group A than those in group B. There was no statistical significance between two groups in postoperative continuous irrigation and vacuum drainage days. The ESR and CRP curves in two group showed a similar trend during 18 months follow up. The VAS and ODI in two groups significantly decreased 6 months and 18 months postsurgery. There was no significant difference in the incidence of complication between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS


Two procedures yielded comparable and satisfactory results. Unilateral PEDL showed shorter operative time and decreased intraoperative fluoroscopy times than bilateral PEDL.

184,31557280,Tryptophan catabolites as metabolic markers of vitamin B-6 status evaluated in cohorts of healthy adults and cardiovascular patients.,"BACKGROUND


Vitamin B-6 status is routinely measured as pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) in plasma. Low concentrations of PLP are associated with rheumatic, cardiovascular, and neoplastic diseases. We have previously shown that vitamin B-6 status affects the kynurenine (Kyn) pathway of tryptophan (Trp) catabolism.
OBJECTIVE


This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the use of Kyns as potential markers of functional vitamin B-6 status across 2 large cohorts.
METHODS


We measured circulating concentrations of the first 6 metabolites in the Trp catabolic pathway by LC-MS-MS in the community-based Hordaland Health Study (HUSK; n = 7017) and cardiovascular patient-based Western Norway Coronary Angiography Cohort (WECAC; n = 4161). Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of plasma PLP with Kyns were estimated using linear and nonlinear regression-based methods.
RESULTS


3'-Hydroxykynurenine (HK), a substrate, and all 4 products formed directly by the PLP-dependent enzymes kynurenine transaminase and kynureninase contributed to the explanation of circulating PLP in multivariable-adjusted regression models. The construct HK:(kynurenic acid + xanthurenic acid + 3'-hydroxyanthranilic acid + anthranilic acid), termed HK ratio (HKr), was related to plasma PLP with standardized regression coefficients (95% CIs) of -0.47 (-0.49, -0.45) and -0.46 (-0.49, -0.43) in HUSK and WECAC, respectively. Across strata of cohort and sex, HKr was 1.3- to 2.7-fold more sensitive, but also 1.7- to 2.9-fold more specific to changes in PLP than a previously proposed marker, HK:xanthurenic acid. Notably, the association was strongest at PLP concentrations < ∼20 nmol/L, a recognized threshold for vitamin B-6 deficiency. Finally, PLP and HKr demonstrated highly sex-specific and corroborating associations with age.
CONCLUSIONS


The results demonstrate that by combining 5 metabolites in the Kyn pathway into a simple index, HKr, a sensitive and specific indicator of intracellular vitamin B-6 status is obtained. The data also underscore the merit of evaluating alterations in Kyn metabolism when investigating vitamin B-6 and health.",2020,"Across strata of cohort and sex, HKr was 1.3- to 2.7-fold more sensitive, but also 1.7- to 2.9-fold more specific to changes in PLP than a previously proposed marker, HK:xanthurenic acid.",['healthy adults and cardiovascular patients'],"['Tryptophan catabolites', ""3'-Hydroxykynurenine (HK""]",[],"[{'cui': 'C0686750', 'cui_str': 'Well adult'}, {'cui': 'C0007226', 'cui_str': 'Structure of cardiovascular system'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}]","[{'cui': 'C0041249', 'cui_str': 'Tryptophan'}]",[],7017.0,0.0393298,"Across strata of cohort and sex, HKr was 1.3- to 2.7-fold more sensitive, but also 1.7- to 2.9-fold more specific to changes in PLP than a previously proposed marker, HK:xanthurenic acid.","[{'ForeName': 'Arve', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Ulvik', 'Affiliation': 'Bevital, Bergen, Norway.'}, {'ForeName': 'Øivind', 'Initials': 'Ø', 'LastName': 'Midttun', 'Affiliation': 'Bevital, Bergen, Norway.'}, {'ForeName': 'Adrian', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'McCann', 'Affiliation': 'Bevital, Bergen, Norway.'}, {'ForeName': 'Klaus', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Meyer', 'Affiliation': 'Bevital, Bergen, Norway.'}, {'ForeName': 'Grethe', 'Initials': 'G', 'LastName': 'Tell', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Global Public Health and Primary Care, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.'}, {'ForeName': 'Ottar', 'Initials': 'O', 'LastName': 'Nygård', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Heart Disease, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.'}, {'ForeName': 'Per M', 'Initials': 'PM', 'LastName': 'Ueland', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.'}]",The American journal of clinical nutrition,['10.1093/ajcn/nqz228']
185,32342498,Efficacy of quadruple treatment on different types of pre-operative anaemia: secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial.,"In patients with pre-operative anaemia undergoing cardiac surgery, combination treatment with intravenous iron, subcutaneous erythropoietin alpha, vitamin B12 and oral folic acid reduces allogeneic blood product transfusions. It is unclear if certain types of anaemia particularly benefit from this treatment. We performed a post-hoc analysis of anaemic patients from a randomised trial on the 'Effect of ultra-short-term treatment of patients with iron deficiency or anaemia undergoing cardiac surgery'. We used linear regression analyses to examine the efficacy of a combination anaemia treatment compared with placebo on the following deficiencies, each representing a part of the combination treatment: ferritin and transferrin saturation; endogenous erythropoietin; holotranscobalamine; and folic acid in erythrocytes. Efficacy was defined as change in reticulocyte count from baseline to the first, third and fifth postoperative days and represented erythropoietic activity in the immediate peri-operative recovery phase. In all 253 anaemic patients, iron deficiency was the most common cause of anaemia. Treatment significantly increased reticulocyte count in all regression analyses on postoperative days 1, 3 and 5 (all p < 0.001).

186,32342559,Efficacy and safety of a soft contact lens to control myopia progression.,"CLINICAL RELEVANCE


The control of myopia progression is currently considered an evidence-based therapeutic need.
BACKGROUND


To determine the efficacy and safety of the Esencia lens, a new soft contact lens (SCL) designed to slow down myopia progression in paediatric patients.
METHODS


This study was a randomised, parallel, double-masked clinical trial. Seventy myopic (-0.50 to -8.75 D) boys and girls, 7-15 years of age, were randomised and allocated to one of two groups: (i) study (n = 36) or (ii) control (n = 34). Study group patients were given the Esencia lens, a progressive multifocal and reverse geometry SCL. Control group patients were given conventional SCLs. Efficacy measurements (change in cycloplegic autorefraction and axial length) were measured at baseline and at the six-month intervals over a 12- month period. Visual performance measurements were corneal power, comfort, quality of vision and contact lens fitting. Safety measures included detection of adverse events.
RESULTS


Mean changes in cycloplegic autorefraction after 12 months were -0.28 ± 0.35 D for study and -0.57 ± 0.52 D for control group patients (p = 0.02). A significantly lower increase in axial length was found in the study group (0.13 ± 0.12 mm) compared to control (0.22 ± 0.14 mm) patients (p = 0.03). Compared to control group patients, there was less myopia progression in the study group: 51 and 41 per cent in terms of cycloplegic autorefraction and axial length, respectively. No significant differences between groups for change in corneal power, comfort, vision quality and contact lens fitting were found (p > 0.05). Regarding safety, there were no serious and/or unexpected adverse events during the study.
CONCLUSIONS


The Esencia lens seems to be efficacious in slowing down progression of myopia in children compared to traditional SCLs in the short term, with comparable safety features and visual outcomes.",2020,"No significant differences between groups for change in corneal power, comfort, vision quality and contact lens fitting were found (p > 0.05).","['Seventy myopic (-0.50 to -8.75 D) boys and girls, 7-15\u2009years of age', 'paediatric patients']","['soft contact lens', 'new soft contact lens (SCL', 'conventional SCLs']","['Mean changes in cycloplegic autorefraction', 'myopia progression', 'Efficacy and safety', 'corneal power, comfort, vision quality and contact lens fitting', 'detection of adverse events', 'axial length', 'Efficacy measurements (change in cycloplegic autorefraction and axial length', 'Visual performance measurements were corneal power, comfort, quality of vision and contact lens fitting']","[{'cui': 'C3816957', 'cui_str': '70'}, {'cui': 'C0027092', 'cui_str': 'Myopia'}, {'cui': 'C4517881', 'cui_str': '8.75'}, {'cui': 'C0870221', 'cui_str': 'Male child'}, {'cui': 'C0043210', 'cui_str': 'Woman'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0030755', 'cui_str': 'Pediatric specialty'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}]","[{'cui': 'C0205358', 'cui_str': 'Soft'}, {'cui': 'C0332158', 'cui_str': 'Contact with'}, {'cui': 'C1444754', 'cui_str': 'Length'}, {'cui': 'C0205314', 'cui_str': 'New'}, {'cui': 'C0439858', 'cui_str': 'Conventional'}]","[{'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0392747', 'cui_str': 'Changing'}, {'cui': 'C0010586', 'cui_str': 'Cycloplegic preparation'}, {'cui': 'C0027092', 'cui_str': 'Myopia'}, {'cui': 'C0242656', 'cui_str': 'Course of illness'}, {'cui': 'C1280519', 'cui_str': 'Effectiveness'}, {'cui': 'C0036043', 'cui_str': 'Safety'}, {'cui': 'C0042789', 'cui_str': 'Visual function'}, {'cui': 'C0332306', 'cui_str': 'Quality'}, {'cui': 'C0332158', 'cui_str': 'Contact with'}, {'cui': 'C1444754', 'cui_str': 'Length'}, {'cui': 'C0036572', 'cui_str': 'Seizure'}, {'cui': 'C0206100', 'cui_str': 'Signal Detection (Psychology)'}, {'cui': 'C0877248', 'cui_str': 'Adverse event'}, {'cui': 'C0205131', 'cui_str': 'Axial'}, {'cui': 'C0242485', 'cui_str': 'Measurement'}, {'cui': 'C0234621', 'cui_str': 'Visual'}]",70.0,0.0807269,"No significant differences between groups for change in corneal power, comfort, vision quality and contact lens fitting were found (p > 0.05).","[{'ForeName': 'Alba M', 'Initials': 'AM', 'LastName': 'Garcia-Del Valle', 'Affiliation': 'School of Optometry, Universidad San Pablo-CEU, CEU Universities, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Vanesa', 'Initials': 'V', 'LastName': 'Blázquez', 'Affiliation': 'Service of Ophthalmology, Clínica Rementería, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Juan', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Gros-Otero', 'Affiliation': 'School of Optometry, Universidad San Pablo-CEU, CEU Universities, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Mónica', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Infante', 'Affiliation': 'Service of Paediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Antonio', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Culebras', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Contactology, Contactología Clínica y Oftálmica, Sevilla, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Antonio', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Verdejo', 'Affiliation': 'Deparment of Contactology, Clínica Real Visión, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Javier', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Sebastián', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Clínica Q-Visión, Hospital Vithas Virgen del Mar, Almería, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Marcos', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'García', 'Affiliation': 'Optometry Service, Clínica Oftalmológica Lasik Centre, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Sara', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Bueno', 'Affiliation': 'School of Optometry, Universidad San Pablo-CEU, CEU Universities, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'David P', 'Initials': 'DP', 'LastName': 'Piñero', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Optics, Pharmacology and Anatomy, University of Alicante, Alicante, Spain.'}]",Clinical & experimental optometry,['10.1111/cxo.13077']
187,32342562,Randomized Clinical Trial of First-Line Genome Sequencing in Pediatric White Matter Disorders.,"OBJECTIVE


Genome sequencing (GS) is promising for unsolved leukodystrophies, but its efficacy has not been prospectively studied.
METHODS


A prospective time-delayed cross-over design trial of GS to assess the efficacy of GS as a first-line diagnostic tool for genetic white matter disorders took place between 12/01/2015 - 09/27/2017. Patients were randomized to receive GS immediately with concurrent standard of care (SoC) testing, or to receive SoC testing for four months followed by GS.
RESULTS


34 individuals were assessed at interim review. The genetic origin of two patient's leukoencephalopathy was resolved before randomization. Nine patients stratified to the immediate intervention group and 23 patients to the delayed-GS arm. The efficacy of GS was significant relative to SoC in the Immediate (5 of 9 [56%] vs. 0 of 9 [0%]; Wild-Seber p < 0.005) and Delayed (control) arms (14 of 23 [61%] vs 5 of 23 [22%]; Wild-Seber p < 0.005). The time to diagnosis was significantly shorter in the immediate-GS group (log rank test, p=0.04). The overall diagnostic efficacy of combined GS and SoC approaches was 26 of 34 (76.5% [95% CI = 58.8% to 89.3%]) in less than 4 months, greater than historical norms of less than 50% over 5 years. Owing to loss of clinical equipoise, the trial design was altered to a single-arm observational study.

In this study, first-line GS provided earlier and greater diagnostic efficacy in white matter disorders.

188,32342619,Effect of metformin on cardiovascular risk factors in middle-aged Thai women with metabolic syndrome: A randomized placebo-controlled trial.,"AIM


To evaluate the effect of metformin on cardiovascular risk factors in middle-aged Thai women with metabolic syndrome that are in menopausal transition.
METHODS


This study was double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. Metabolic syndrome was diagnosed using American Heart Association and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria. After taking metformin 1700 mg/day for 6 months, cardiovascular risk factors were evaluated at baseline and month-6; the values of which were used to calculate delta (Δ, month-6 minus baseline values).
RESULTS


Forty menopausal participants were equally, randomized into either the placebo or metformin group. The two groups had comparable metabolic parameters at baseline, except that the mean triglyceride level was higher in the metformin group than in the placebo group. The significant improvements found only in the metformin group were body mass index, fasting blood glucose, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (Framingham heart study) (P = 0.0004, P = 0.049, P = 0.035 and P = 0.029); whereas that only in the placebo group was high density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the improvement between the two groups.
CONCLUSION


Metformin can improve some parameters of metabolic syndrome in middle-aged Thai women.

189,32342642,Resting metabolic rate and skeletal muscle SERCA and Na +  /K +  ATPase activities are not affected by fish oil supplementation in healthy older adults.,"Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have unique properties purported to influence several aspects of metabolism, including energy expenditure and protein function. Supplementing with n-3 PUFAs may increase whole-body resting metabolic rate (RMR), by enhancing Na +  /K +  ATPase (NKA) activity and reducing the efficiency of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2+  ATPase (SERCA) activity by inducing a Ca 2+  leak-pump cycle. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of fish oil (FO) on RMR, substrate oxidation, and skeletal muscle SERCA and NKA pump function in healthy older individuals. Subjects (n = 16 females; n = 8 males; 65 ± 1 years) were randomly assigned into groups supplemented with either olive oil (OO) (5 g/day) or FO (5 g/day) containing 2 g/day eicosapentaenoic acid and 1 g/day docosahexaenoic acid for 12 weeks. Participants visited the laboratory for RMR and substrate oxidation measurements after an overnight fast at weeks 0 and 12. Skeletal muscle biopsies were taken during weeks 0 and 12 for analysis of NKA and SERCA function and protein content.

In PALOMA-2, palbociclib + letrozole significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo + letrozole in patients with estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER + /HER2 - ) advanced breast cancer (ABC). We investigated clinical outcomes of patients who achieved or did not achieve a confirmed objective response (OR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (data cutoff: May 31, 2017).
PATIENTS AND METHODS


Postmenopausal patients untreated for ER + /HER2 -  ABC were randomized 2:1 to palbociclib + letrozole or placebo + letrozole. Median PFS, median duration of OR, baseline characteristics, and palbociclib exposure were compared in patients with or without OR by treatment arm.
RESULTS


In the intent-to-treat population, OR was achieved by 194 (44%) of 444 and 77 (35%) of 222 patients in the palbociclib and placebo arms, respectively (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-2.1; P = .0156). Regardless of treatment, more OR than non-OR patients had de novo metastatic disease (47%-50% and 28%-31%, respectively) and no prior endocrine therapy (55% and 35%-37%, respectively). Rates of palbociclib dose reduction owing to adverse events were similar regardless of OR (41% and 38%, respectively). Among the patients with OR during the study, approximately 50% achieved OR within the first 3 months regardless of treatment. The median PFS was significantly prolonged with palbociclib + letrozole versus placebo + letrozole in patients with measurable disease in both OR (37.2 months; 95% CI, 28.1 months to not estimable vs. 27.4 months; 95% CI, 22.2-31.1 months; hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47-0.94; P = .009) and non-OR groups (10.9 months; 95% CI, 8.2-11.2 months vs. 5.6 months; 95% CI, 5.3-8.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54-0.97; P = .016).

191,29774787,Variability of attention bias in socially anxious adolescents: differences in fixation duration toward adult and adolescent face stimuli.,"Prior research on attention bias in anxious youth, often utilising a visual dot probe task, has yielded inconsistent findings, which may be due to how bias is assessed and/or variability in the phenomenon. The present study utilises eye gaze tracking to assess attention bias in socially anxious adolescents, and explores several methodological and within-subject factors that may contribute to variability in attention bias. Attention bias to threat was measured in forty-two treatment-seeking adolescents (age 12-16 years) diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder. Bias scores toward emotional stimuli (vigilant attention) and bias scores away from emotional stimuli (avoidant attention) were explored. Bias scores changed between vigilance and avoidance within individuals and over the course of stimulus presentation. These differences were not associated with participant characteristics nor with self-reported social anxiety symptoms. However, clinician rated severity of social anxiety, explained a significant proportion of variance in the bias scores for adult, but not the adolescent, stimuli. Variability in attention bias among socially anxious adolescents is common and varies as a function of stimulus duration and type. Results may inform stimulus selection for future research.",2019,These differences were not associated with participant characteristics nor with self-reported social anxiety symptoms.,"['socially anxious adolescents', 'anxious youth', 'forty-two treatment-seeking adolescents (age 12-16 years) diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder']",[],"['Bias scores toward emotional stimuli (vigilant attention) and bias scores away from emotional stimuli (avoidant attention', 'social anxiety symptoms', 'social anxiety']","[{'cui': 'C0003467', 'cui_str': 'Anxiety'}, {'cui': 'C0205653', 'cui_str': 'Adolescent'}, {'cui': 'C0001578', 'cui_str': 'Adolescence'}, {'cui': 'C4319566', 'cui_str': '42'}, {'cui': 'C0039798', 'cui_str': 'therapy'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0011900', 'cui_str': 'Diagnosis'}, {'cui': 'C0031572', 'cui_str': 'Social phobia'}]",[],"[{'cui': 'C0005346', 'cui_str': 'Biases'}, {'cui': 'C0449820', 'cui_str': 'Score'}, {'cui': 'C0013987', 'cui_str': 'Emotion'}, {'cui': 'C0234402', 'cui_str': 'Stimulus'}, {'cui': 'C0043012', 'cui_str': 'Wakefulness'}, {'cui': 'C0004268', 'cui_str': 'Attention'}, {'cui': 'C0424166', 'cui_str': 'Social fear'}, {'cui': 'C0683368', 'cui_str': 'symptoms'}]",,0.0234497,These differences were not associated with participant characteristics nor with self-reported social anxiety symptoms.,"[{'ForeName': 'Andrea Trubanova', 'Initials': 'AT', 'LastName': 'Wieckowski', 'Affiliation': 'a Department of Psychology (0436) , Virginia Tech , Blacksburg , USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Nicole N', 'Initials': 'NN', 'LastName': 'Capriola-Hall', 'Affiliation': 'a Department of Psychology (0436) , Virginia Tech , Blacksburg , USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Rebecca', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Elias', 'Affiliation': 'a Department of Psychology (0436) , Virginia Tech , Blacksburg , USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Thomas H', 'Initials': 'TH', 'LastName': 'Ollendick', 'Affiliation': 'a Department of Psychology (0436) , Virginia Tech , Blacksburg , USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Susan W', 'Initials': 'SW', 'LastName': 'White', 'Affiliation': 'a Department of Psychology (0436) , Virginia Tech , Blacksburg , USA.'}]",Cognition & emotion,['10.1080/02699931.2018.1476322']

We found that feasible (vs. desirable) gifts led recipients to feel psychologically closer to givers (Studies 1-4). Further clarifying the process by which receiving a desirable versus feasible gift affects perceived distance, when recipients were told that the giver focused on the gift's practicality or ease of use (vs. the gift's overall quality), while holding the specific features of the gifts constant, they felt closer to the gift-giver (Study 5).

Hydrogen-oxygen mixture (H2-O2) may reduce airway resistance in patients with acute severe tracheal stenosis, yet data supporting the clinical use of H2-O2 are insufficient.
OBJECTIVES


To evaluate the efficacy and safety of breathing H2-O2 in acute severe tracheal stenosis.
METHODS


Thirty-five consecutive patients with severe acute tracheal stenosis were recruited in this prospective self-control study. Air, H2-O2 and O2 inhalation was given in 4 consecutive breathing steps: air for 15 min, H2-O2 (6 L per min, H2:O2 = 2: 1) for 15 min, oxygen (3 L per min) for 15 min, and H2-O2 for 120 min. The primary endpoint was inspiratory effort as assessed by diaphragm electromyography (EMGdi); the secondary endpoints were transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), Borg score, vital signs, and impulse oscillometry (IOS). The concentration of H2 in the ambient environment was obtained with 12 monitors. Adverse reactions during the inhalation were recorded.
RESULTS


The mean reduction in the EMGdi under H2-O2 was 10.53 ± 6.83%. The EMGdi significantly decreased during 2 H2-O2 inhalation steps (Steps 2 and 4) compared with air (Step 1) and O2 (Step 3) (52.95 ± 15.00 vs. 42.46 ± 13.90 vs. 53.20 ± 14.74 vs. 42.50 ± 14.12% for Steps 1 through 4, p < 0.05). The mean reduction in the Pdi under H2-O2 was 4.77 ± 3.51 cmH2O. Breathing H2-O2 significantly improved the Borg score and resistance parameters of IOS but not vital signs. No adverse reactions occurred. H2 was undetectable in the environment throughout the procedure.

Methods:  A matching-adjusted indirect comparison method was implemented to adjust for cross-trial differences in patient characteristics between ASCEND-4 and PROFILE 1014 trials. Patient-level data from ASCEND-4 and published summary data from PROFILE 1014 were used. Patients in ASCEND-4 were reweighted to match average baseline characteristics (i.e. age, sex, race, tumor histology, ECOG score, smoking status, extent of disease, and presence of brain metastases) reported for PROFILE 1014 patients using propensity score weighting. PFS and OS were then compared between balanced populations. Results:  ASCEND-4 included more current smokers (8.0% vs 4.4%) and fewer patients under the age of 65 years (78.5% vs 84.0%) compared to PROFILE 1014. After matching, these and all other patient characteristics were balanced between the two trial populations.

195,30423452,Assessment of associations between mitochondrial DNA haplogroups and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder in Korean children.,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a multifactorial disorder with multiple environmental and biological etiologies, including genetic factors. Until now, several genetic variants have been reported to be significantly associated with ADHD. Recently, the relationship between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia has also been reported. However, currently there are no reports pertaining to the genetic association between mtDNA haplogroups and ADHD. Therefore, we performed an mtDNA haplogroup analysis of a total of 472 Korean children (150 Children with ADHD and 322 controls). The 20 East Asian specific mtDNA haplogroups were determined using the SNaPshot assay. We also sequenced the displacement loop (D-loop) region, position 15,971-613. Our results showed that haplogroup B4 was significantly associated with ADHD (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.055-3.429; p = 0.031). A marginally significant association was found in subjects with ADHD and haplogroup B5 (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.059-1.139; p = 0.041). When stratified based on gender, an association was also observed between haplogroup B5 and boys diagnosed with ADHD (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.022-1.340; p = 0.048). Compared with boys, girls with ADHD carried an excess of the haplogroup D4b (OR, 4.83; 95% CI, 1.352-17.272; p = 0.014). Stratified analysis of subtypes also showed significant results (combined: haplogroup B4, p = 0.007; inattentive: haplogroup F, p = 0.022).

196,32346715,[Clinical observation of delayed implantation and immediate implantation after minimally invasive extraction].,"PURPOSE


To explore and compare the clinical effects of delayed implantation and immediate implantation after minimally invasive extraction.
METHODS


Eight-six patients from Nanjing Tongren Hospital who underwent minimally invasive extraction of the upper and lower mandibular anterior teeth and premolars from April 2013 to April 2018 were randomly divided into the control group and the experimental group. Forty patients in the control group were treated with delayed implantation after minimally invasive extraction, while 46 in the experimental group underwent immediate implant treatment after minimally invasive extraction. The success rate of the two groups of patients was compared, and the implant stability, the depth of probing around the implant, the aesthetic effect, and the bone level at the edge of the implant and the satisfaction after follow-up were recorded 3 months after implantation and at the day of permanent repair. The data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 software package.
RESULTS


After treatment, the success rate of the control group was 100%, and the success rate of the experimental group was 100%(P>0.05). The ISQ of the 2 groups 3 months after implant placement and at the day of permanent repair had no significant difference(P>0.05); the depth of probing around the implants in the experimental group was smaller than that in the control group, but the difference was not significant(P=0.80); the total satisfaction of the experimental group was greater than that of the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P=0.044); one year after repair, the gingival nipple index was in grade 1-3, the soft tissue shape was good, all achieved good gingival aesthetic effect, the difference between the two groups was not significant(P=0.66). PES score of the control group was 7.65±1.32, and 8.25±1.19 in the experimental group, the difference was significant (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the amount of bone absorption both in the mesial and distal sides between the two groups (P>0.05).

197,32346743,Effects of Adding Motor Imagery to Early Physical Therapy in Patients with Knee Osteoarthritis who Had Received Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"OBJECTIVE


To investigate the effects of the inclusion of motor imagery (MI) principles into early physical therapy on pain, disability, pressure pain thresholds (PPTs), and range of motion in the early postsurgical phase after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS


A randomized clinical trial including patients with knee osteoarthritis who have received TKA was conducted. Participants were randomized to receive five treatment sessions of either physical therapy with or without MI principles in an early postsurgical phase after a TKA (five days after surgery). Pain intensity (visual analog scale [VAS], 0-100), pain-related disability (short-form Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC], 0-32), pressure pain thresholds (PPTs), and knee range of motion were assessed before and after five daily treatment sessions by an assessor blinded to the subject's condition.
RESULTS


Twenty-four participants completed data collection and treatment. The adjusted analysis revealed significant group*time interactions for WOMAC (F = 17.29, P = 0.001, η2 = 0.48) and VAS (F = 14.56, P < 0.001, η2 = 0.45); patients receiving physiotherapy and MI principles experienced greater improvements in pain (Δ -28.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -43.0 to -13.0) and pain-related disability (Δ -6.0, 95% CI = -8.3 to -3.7) than those receiving physiotherapy alone. No significant group*time interactions for knee range of motion and PPTs were observed (all, P  > 0.30).

The application of MI to early physiotherapy was effective for improving pain and disability, but not range of motion or pressure pain sensitivity, in the early postsurgical phase after TKA in people with knee osteoarthritis.",2020,"The application of MI to early physiotherapy was effective for improving pain and disability, but not range of motion or pressure pain sensitivity, in the early postsurgical phase after TKA in people with knee osteoarthritis.","['Patients with Knee Osteoarthritis who Had Received Total Knee Arthroplasty', 'patients with knee osteoarthritis who have received TKA was conducted', 'people with knee osteoarthritis']","['motor imagery', 'physical therapy with or without MI principles', 'Motor Imagery to Early Physical Therapy']","['pain and disability', 'VAS', 'knee range of motion and PPTs', 'pain, disability, pressure pain thresholds (PPTs), and range of motion in the early postsurgical phase after total knee arthroplasty (TKA', 'Pain intensity (visual analog scale [VAS], 0-100), pain-related disability (short-form Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC], 0-32), pressure pain thresholds (PPTs), and knee range of motion', 'pain', 'pain-related disability']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0409959', 'cui_str': 'Osteoarthritis of knee'}, {'cui': 'C0086511', 'cui_str': 'Total knee replacement'}, {'cui': 'C0004927', 'cui_str': 'Behavior finding'}, {'cui': 'C0027361', 'cui_str': 'Person'}]","[{'cui': 'C0150627', 'cui_str': 'Simple guided imagery'}, {'cui': 'C0031818', 'cui_str': 'Physiotherapy Specialty'}, {'cui': 'C1279919', 'cui_str': 'Early'}]","[{'cui': 'C0030193', 'cui_str': 'Pain'}, {'cui': 'C0231170', 'cui_str': 'Disability'}, {'cui': 'C0042815', 'cui_str': 'Visual analog pain scale'}, {'cui': 'C0576094', 'cui_str': 'Knee joint - range of movement'}, {'cui': 'C0033095', 'cui_str': 'Pressure - physical agent'}, {'cui': 'C0162703', 'cui_str': 'Pain threshold'}, {'cui': 'C0080078', 'cui_str': 'Range of joint movement'}, {'cui': 'C1279919', 'cui_str': 'Early'}, {'cui': 'C0205390', 'cui_str': 'Phase'}, {'cui': 'C0086511', 'cui_str': 'Total knee replacement'}, {'cui': 'C1320357', 'cui_str': 'Pain intensity'}, {'cui': 'C1704407', 'cui_str': '100'}, {'cui': 'C0439849', 'cui_str': 'Relationships'}, {'cui': 'C0453933', 'cui_str': 'Shorts'}, {'cui': 'C0205431', 'cui_str': 'Formed'}, {'cui': 'C0029040', 'cui_str': 'Ontario'}, {'cui': 'C0041740', 'cui_str': 'University'}, {'cui': 'C0029408', 'cui_str': 'Degenerative polyarthritis'}, {'cui': 'C0600653', 'cui_str': 'Indexes'}]",24.0,0.170084,"The application of MI to early physiotherapy was effective for improving pain and disability, but not range of motion or pressure pain sensitivity, in the early postsurgical phase after TKA in people with knee osteoarthritis.","[{'ForeName': 'María', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Briones-Cantero', 'Affiliation': 'Unidad de Fisioterapia, Servicio de Rehabilitación, Hospital Universitario Doce de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'César', 'Initials': 'C', 'LastName': 'Fernández-de-Las-Peñas', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Alcorcón, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Enrique', 'Initials': 'E', 'LastName': 'Lluch-Girbés', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy, Universidad de Valencia, Valencia, Spain; Pain in Motion Research Group.'}, {'ForeName': 'María C', 'Initials': 'MC', 'LastName': 'Osuna-Pérez', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, Universidad de Jaén, Jaén, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Marcos J', 'Initials': 'MJ', 'LastName': 'Navarro-Santana', 'Affiliation': 'Rehabilitación San Fernando, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Gustavo', 'Initials': 'G', 'LastName': 'Plaza-Manzano', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Rehabilitation and Physiotherapy, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Patricia', 'Initials': 'P', 'LastName': 'Martín-Casas', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Rehabilitation and Physiotherapy, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.'}]","Pain medicine (Malden, Mass.)",['10.1093/pm/pnaa103']
198,32346779,[Arthroscopically-assisted treatment of acute and chronic dislocations of the acromioclavicular joint : A prospective clinical trial].,"BACKGROUND


Injuries of the acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) are frequent and often occur during sports. While arthroscopically-assisted stabilization of acute injuries of the ACJ is a well-established procedure, there is not much data available for arthroscopically-assisted stabilization of chronic injuries of the ACJ.
OBJECTIVES


This study assesses clinical and radiological results of arthroscopically-assisted stabilization of acute and chronic injuries of the ACJ.
MATERIALS AND METHODS


Thirty-six patients with acute and chronic injuries of the ACJ were assessed in a prospective clinical trial. Twenty-five patients with acute injuries (group A) and eleven patients with chronic injuries (group B) were included in this study. Patients of group A were operated using two suture-button systems, while patients of group B received one suture-button system and an autologous gracilis tendon graft.
RESULTS


In group A, the mean preoperative Constant score rated 38, and the ASES score rated 34. At follow-up the Constant score (92) and the ASES score (89) had improved. Panorama views revealed an increased coracoclavicular distance of the affected shoulder (15.8 mm) in comparison to the contralateral shoulder (10.9 mm). In group B, the preoperative Constant score measured 57. It improved to 72 points at follow-up. The ASES score improved from 39 to 72 points in the same period. Panorama views revealed an increased coracoclavicular distance of the affected shoulder (18.9 mm) in comparison to the contralateral shoulder (12.4 mm).
CONCLUSIONS


Stabilization of acute injuries of the ACJ with two suture-button systems is related to very good shoulder function after one year. The native coracoclavicular distance cannot be restored with this procedure. Stabilization of chronic injuries of the ACJ with a suture-button system and an autologous gracilis tendon graft is related to improved shoulder function after one year. However, shoulder function cannot be fully restored with the stabilization technique presented.",2020,Panorama views revealed an increased coracoclavicular distance of the affected shoulder (15.8 mm) in comparison to the contralateral shoulder (10.9 mm).,"['Twenty-five patients with acute injuries (group\xa0A) and eleven patients with chronic injuries (group\xa0B', 'Thirty-six patients with acute and chronic injuries of the ACJ', 'Patients of group']",['suture-button system and an autologous gracilis tendon graft'],"['ASES score', 'coracoclavicular distance', 'shoulder function']","[{'cui': 'C3715062', 'cui_str': '25'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0205178', 'cui_str': 'Acuteness'}, {'cui': 'C0005604', 'cui_str': 'Birth trauma'}, {'cui': 'C0441835', 'cui_str': 'Group A'}, {'cui': 'C0205191', 'cui_str': 'Chronic'}, {'cui': 'C0348801', 'cui_str': 'Group B streptococcal pneumonia'}, {'cui': 'C4319606', 'cui_str': '36'}, {'cui': 'C0001208', 'cui_str': 'Acromioclavicular joint structure'}, {'cui': 'C0439745', 'cui_str': 'Grouped'}]","[{'cui': 'C0183717', 'cui_str': 'Suture button'}, {'cui': 'C0085104', 'cui_str': 'Drug Targeting'}, {'cui': 'C0439859', 'cui_str': 'Autologous'}, {'cui': 'C0448621', 'cui_str': 'Tendon of gracilis'}, {'cui': 'C0181074', 'cui_str': 'Graft material'}]","[{'cui': 'C0449820', 'cui_str': 'Score'}, {'cui': 'C0012751', 'cui_str': 'Distance'}, {'cui': 'C0037004', 'cui_str': 'Shoulder region structure'}, {'cui': 'C0031843', 'cui_str': 'PH'}]",25.0,0.0324864,Panorama views revealed an increased coracoclavicular distance of the affected shoulder (15.8 mm) in comparison to the contralateral shoulder (10.9 mm).,"[{'ForeName': 'Malte', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Holschen', 'Affiliation': 'Klinik für Unfall- und orthopädische Chirurgie, Raphaelsklinik Münster, Loerstr.\xa023, 48143, Münster, Deutschland. holmal@web.de.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jonas', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Focke', 'Affiliation': 'Orthopädische Praxisklinik Münster, Münster, Deutschland.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kai-Axel', 'Initials': 'KA', 'LastName': 'Witt', 'Affiliation': 'Orthopädische Praxisklinik Münster, Münster, Deutschland.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jörn', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Steinbeck', 'Affiliation': 'Orthopädische Praxisklinik Münster, Münster, Deutschland.'}]",Der Orthopade,['10.1007/s00132-020-03914-8']

200,32346816,Agreement Among Paper and Electronic Modes of the EQ-5D-5L.,"INTRODUCTION


While the EQ-5D-5L has been migrated to several electronic modes, evidence supporting the measurement equivalence of the original paper-based instrument to the electronic modes is limited.
OBJECTIVES


This study was designed to comprehensively examine the equivalence of the paper and electronic modes (i.e., handheld, tablet, interactive voice response [IVR], and web).
METHODS


As part of the foundational work for this study, the test-retest reliability of the paper-based, UK English format of the EQ-5D-5L was assessed using a single-group, single-visit, two-period, repeated-measures design. To compare paper and electronic modes, three independent samples were recruited into a three-period crossover study. Each participant was assigned to one of six groups to account for order effects. Descriptive statistics, mean differences (i.e., split-plot analysis of variance [ANOVA]), and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated.
RESULTS


The test-retest results showed mean differences near zero and ICC values > 0.90 for both the index and the EQ VAS scores. For the electronic comparisons, mean difference confidence intervals (CIs) for the EQ-5D index scores and EQ VAS scores reflected equivalence of the means across all modes, as the CIs were wholly contained inside the equivalence interval. Further, the ICC 95% lower CIs for the index and EQ VAS scores showed values above the thresholds for denoting equivalence across all comparisons in each sample. No significant mode-by-order interactions were present in any ANOVA model.
CONCLUSIONS


Overall, our comparisons of the paper, screen-based, and phone-based formats of the EQ-5D-5L provided substantial evidence to support the measurement equivalence of these modes of data collection.",2020,The test-retest results showed mean differences near zero and ICC values > 0.90 for both the index and the EQ VAS scores.,[],['EQ-5D-5L'],"['intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs', 'EQ VAS scores', 'EQ-5D index scores and EQ VAS scores']",[],[],"[{'cui': 'C0010101', 'cui_str': 'Correlation Studies'}, {'cui': 'C0042815', 'cui_str': 'Visual analog pain scale'}, {'cui': 'C0449820', 'cui_str': 'Score'}, {'cui': 'C0600653', 'cui_str': 'Indexes'}]",,0.036839,The test-retest results showed mean differences near zero and ICC values > 0.90 for both the index and the EQ VAS scores.,"[{'ForeName': 'J Jason', 'Initials': 'JJ', 'LastName': 'Lundy', 'Affiliation': 'Outcometrix, 433 Central Avenue, Suite 300, St. Petersburg, FL, 33701, USA. jlundy@outcometrix.com.'}, {'ForeName': 'Stephen Joel', 'Initials': 'SJ', 'LastName': 'Coons', 'Affiliation': 'Patient-Reported Outcome Consortium, Critical Path Institute, Tucson, AZ, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Emuella', 'Initials': 'E', 'LastName': 'Flood', 'Affiliation': 'AstraZeneca, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Mira J', 'Initials': 'MJ', 'LastName': 'Patel', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Clinical Outcome Assessment, Office of New Drugs, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, White Oak, MD, USA.'}, {'ForeName': '', 'Initials': '', 'LastName': '', 'Affiliation': ''}]",The patient,['10.1007/s40271-020-00419-6']
201,32344891,Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) for Two Implant Placement Techniques in Sinus Region (Bone Graft versus Computer-Aided Implant Surgery): A Randomized Prospective Trial.,"PURPOSE


To assess patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) for two implant placement techniques in cases of sinus bone atrophy (bone graft surgery (BGS) versus computer-aided implant surgery (CAIS)), after surgery and one year later, and to evaluate the clinical success of both treatments.
METHODS


Sixty patients with bone atrophy in the posterior maxilla and in need of implant placement were randomly assigned to two groups, and in accordance with the case report form (CRF), 30 were treated with BGS and 30 with CAIS. Immediately after treatment and one year later, PROMs were assessed, and the clinical success of both treatments was evaluated.
RESULTS


No significant differences were found between BGS and CAIS with regard to the following: loss of implants ( p  = 492); patient recommendation ( p  = 210); duration of surgery ( p  = 987); pain on the intervention day ( p  = 512); pain in the week after intervention ( p  = 299); and complications in the stage of surgery ( p  = 1.00). Similarly, at one year, no differences were found with regard to the following: pain around implant ( p  = 481); infection of implants ( p  = 491); abnormal radiographic imaging ( p  = 226); occurrence of undesirable events ( p  = 1.00); loss of one of the implants ( p  = 1.00); plaque detection ( p  = 1.00); bleeding on probing ( p  = 236); and presence of keratinized mucosa ( p  = 226). However, a significant difference was found among BGS and CAIS with regard to the number of consultations ( p  = 0001); number of implants placed ( p  = 033); and treatment difficulty ( p  = 0369). Significant differences were found for peri-implantitis ( p  = 0481) and radiology of craterization ( p  = 020) in clinical examination at the first year.
CONCLUSION


Treatment difficulty and number of consultations were higher for BGS than for CAIS, as well as peri-implantitis and bone craterization at one year, indicating significant differences between the two treatments. However, there were no statistically significant differences between BGS and CAIS regarding the other PROMs, at placement and after one year.",2020,"Significant differences were found for peri-implantitis ( p  = 0481) and radiology of craterization ( p  = 020) in clinical examination at the first year.

202,32344934,Lipidomics Reveals Reduced Inflammatory Lipid Species and Storage Lipids after Switching from EFV/FTC/TDF to RPV/FTC/TDF: A Randomized Open-Label Trial.,"HIV and antiretroviral therapy affect lipid metabolism. Lipidomics quantifies several individual species that are overlooked using conventional biochemical analyses, outperforming traditional risk equations. We aimed to compare the plasma lipidomic profile of HIV patients taking efavirenz (EFV) or rilpivirine (RPV). Patients ≥ 18 years old on EFV co-formulated with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) with HIV-RNA < 50 copies/mL for ≥6 months were randomized to continue EFV/FTC/TDF (n = 14) or switch to RPV/FTC/TDF (n =15). Lipidomic analyses conducted by mass spectrometry (MS) were performed at baseline and after 12 and 24 weeks. OWLiver ®  Care and OWLiver ®  tests were performed to estimate the presence of fatty liver disease (NAFLD). No significant differences (83% male, median age 44 years, 6 years receiving EFV/FTC/TDF, CD4 +  count 740 cells/mm 3 , TC 207 [57 HDL-C/133 LDL-C] mg/dL, TG 117 mg/dL) were observed between the groups at baseline. Significant reductions in plasma lipids and lipoproteins but increased circulating bilirubin concentrations were observed in patients who switched to RPV/FTC/TDF. Patients on RPV/FTC/TDF showed a decrease in the global amount of storage lipids (-0.137 log 2  [fold-change] EFV vs. 0.059 log 2  [fold-change] RPV) but an increase in lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) and total steroids.

Using a feminist theoretical approach, the present study was the first to assess the unintended, negative consequences that result when taking a victimization-focused approach to sexual assault prevention. Participants ( N  = 321) were primarily heterosexual, Caucasian undergraduate students from a Western postsecondary institution. A between-participants experimental design was employed, whereby participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (a) victimization-focused prevention tips ( n  = 114; e.g., ""Be alert and aware of your surroundings""); (b) perpetration-focused prevention tips ( n  = 103; e.g., ""Don't slip any unwanted substances into drinks at bars or parties""); or (c) study tips for control purposes ( n  = 104; e.g., ""Take a ten-minute break every hour""). Following prevention tip exposure, participants read a sexual assault vignette and completed measures of victim culpability and several related constructs (i.e., ambivalent sexism, belief in a just world, and rape myth acceptance). Results indicated that participants who received victimization-focused prevention tips attributed significantly more blame to the victimized woman in the vignette than participants in both the control condition and perpetration-focused condition. Based on these results, it is recommended that social institutions further evaluate the efficacy and unintended consequences of prevalent victimization-focused sexual assault prevention strategies. Specifically, institutions should consider the implications of endorsing strategies that are evidenced to enhance victim blame, thereby perpetuating rape culture.

Copeptin, a surrogate marker for arginine vasopressin, has shown promising prognostic features in small observational studies and is used clinically for early rule out of acute coronary syndrome. The objective of this study was to explore the association between early measurements of copeptin, circulatory status, and short-term survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
METHODS


Serial blood samples were collected at 24, 48, and 72 h as part of the target temperature management at 33 °C versus 36 °C after cardiac arrest trial, an international multicenter randomized trial where unconscious survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were allocated to an intervention of 33 or 36 °C for 24 h. Primary outcome was 30-day survival with secondary endpoints circulatory cause of death and cardiovascular deterioration composite; in addition, we examined the correlation with extended the cardiovascular sequential organ failure assessment (eCvSOFA) score.
RESULTS


Six hundred ninety patients were included in the analyses, of whom 203 (30.3%) developed cardiovascular deterioration within 24 h, and 273 (39.6%) died within 30 days. Copeptin measured at 24 h was found to be independently associated with 30-day survival, hazard ratio 1.17 [1.06-1.28], p = 0.001; circulatory cause of death, odds ratio 1.03 [1.01-1.04], p = 0.001; and cardiovascular deterioration composite, odds ratio of 1.05 [1.02-1.08], p < 0.001. Copeptin at 24 h was correlated with eCvSOFA score with rho 0.19 [0.12-0.27], p < 0.001.
CONCLUSION


Copeptin is an independent marker of severity of the post cardiac arrest syndrome, partially related to circulatory failure.

206,32345358,Effect of nutritional interventions on discharged older patients: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND


During hospitalization, many older patients are at nutritional risk or malnourished, and their nutritional condition is often further impaired during hospitalization. After discharge, a ""nutrition gap"" often occurs in which the patient does not receive enough nutrition to ensure an optimal recovery.
METHODS


The study is a randomized controlled study ongoing over 112 days. At discharge, the intervention group receives guidance from a clinical dietitian, and an individualized nutrition plan is made. The dietitian will perform telephone follow-up after 4 and 30 days. It will also be possible for the participant, the participant's relatives, or the participant's municipality to contact the dietitian if nutritional questions arise. At the time of discharge, the intervention group will receive a package containing foods and drinks that will cover their nutritional needs on the first day after discharge. They will also receive a goodie bag containing samples of protein-rich, milk-based drinks. Data are collected on quality of life, appetite, physical function, dietary intake, weight, height, energy and protein needs, and experience of discharge and cooperation with the municipality. Information about nutrition status will be sent to the municipality so that the municipality can take over nutritional treatment. The control group receives a standard treatment.
DISCUSSION


This study is the first to combine previously successful single nutritional interventions into a multimodal intervention whose aim is to obtain an effect on patient-related outcomes. We hope that the results will prove beneficial and help to ensure the cross-sector quality of nutritional support to older patients.

207,32345372,"Protocol for a randomized multicenter study for isolated skin vasculitis (ARAMIS) comparing the efficacy of three drugs: azathioprine, colchicine, and dapsone.","BACKGROUND


Skin-limited forms of vasculitis, while lacking systemic manifestations, can persist or recur indefinitely, cause pain, itch, or ulceration, and be complicated by infection or scarring. High-quality evidence on how to treat these conditions is lacking. The aim of this comparative effectiveness study is to determine the optimal management of patients with chronic skin-limited vasculitis.
METHODS


ARAMIS is a multicenter, sequential, multiple assignment randomized trial with an enrichment design (SMARTER) aimed at comparing the efficacy of three drugs-azathioprine, colchicine, and dapsone-commonly used to treat various forms of isolated skin vasculitis. ARAMIS will enroll patients with isolated cutaneous small or medium vessel vasculitis, including cutaneous small vessel vasculitis, immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis (skin-limited Henoch-Schönlein purpura), and cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa. Patients not responding to the initial assigned therapy will be re-randomized to one of the remaining two study drugs (Stage 2). Those with intolerance or contraindication to a study drug can be randomized directly into Stage 2. Target enrollment is 90 participants, recruited from international centers affiliated with the Vasculitis Clinical Research Consortium. The number of patients enrolled directly into Stage 2 of the study will be capped at 10% of the total recruitment target. The primary study endpoint is the proportion of participants from the pooled study stages with a response to therapy at month 6, according to the study definition.
DISCUSSION


ARAMIS will help identify effective agents for skin-limited forms of vasculitis, an understudied group of diseases. The SMARTER design may serve as an example for future trials in rare diseases.

208,32345375,An early intervention to promote maternal sensitivity in the perinatal period for women with psychosocial vulnerabilities: study protocol of a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND


Maternal mental well-being and social circumstances during pregnancy and early childhood impact the child's well-being and development. Supportive and sensitive parenting is one of the strongest predictors of positive emotional, social and behavioral outcomes for the child. Knowledge is needed about how to detect and support vulnerable families already during pregnancy and in the postnatal period. The aim of this study is to assemble and evaluate an interdisciplinary cross-sectoral intervention to promote maternal sensitivity among women with psychological or social vulnerabilities.
METHODS/DESIGN


This randomized controlled trial tests the efficacy of an intervention program in the perinatal period compared to care as usual in enhancing maternal sensitivity in a group of psychologically or socially vulnerable women in the Capital Region of Denmark. The intervention consists of four components: 1) detecting symptoms of mental illness in vulnerable pregnant women and initiating treatment if indicated, 2) strengthening parenting skills using the Circle of Security Parenting program, 3) supporting breastfeeding, and 4) sharing knowledge and organizing treatment pathways for families across sectors. Seventy-six families will be randomly assigned to the intervention or care-as-usual. Data will be obtained at study inclusion at 3-5 months of pregnancy, eight weeks after childbirth, and nine months after childbirth. The primary outcome is maternal sensitivity. Secondary outcomes include infant's socio-emotional development, parents' mentalization, parental stress, depressive symptoms, and parental wellbeing. Qualitative data will provide insight into the implementation process.
DISCUSSION


This paper presents the rational and background for developing the intervention. Furthermore, the design and protocol of the randomized controlled trial. It is hypothesized that the intervention will be associated with positive changes in primary and secondary outcomes. If effective, the intervention will provide insights into prenatal risk profiles among an identified group of psychosocial vulnerable women important for early screening and point to effective preventive interventions that can support women in the perinatal period, increase maternal sensitivity and promote positive child development -starting before the child is born.

To determine the effect of a novel low volume high intensity concurrent training regimen and warm-up on physiological performance and musculoskeletal injury in Australian recruits.
DESIGN


Controlled longitudinal intervention.
METHODS


Military recruits completed 12 weeks of either experimental (EXP: n=78, 6-8RM resistance loads, and high intensity intervals) or basic military (CON: n=69, usual practice) matched for total sessions and time. Endurance (3.2km 22kg-load carriage, V˙O 2 peak , multi-stage fitness test (MSFT)), 1RM strength and local muscle endurance (bench, squat, box-lift and push-ups) and power (squat jump) were assessed at Weeks 1,6,12. Body composition, physical activity (PAC·min -1 ) and heart rate reserve (HRR%), were assessed at Weeks 2,7,9. Musculoskeletal injury and mechanism were recorded. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA interaction (group×time), mean difference and effect size (ES) are reported p≤0.05.
RESULTS


A significant interaction over 12 weeks was observed for load carriage (ES -0.30), squat jump (ES 0.65), V˙O 2 peak  (ES 0.58), MSFT (ES 0.41), push-ups (ES 0.26), 1RM bench (ES 0.26), squat (ES 1.05) and box lift (ES 0.27) in EXP compared to CON. At Week 12 significantly greater squat (38.9kg), MSFT (2.1mL·kg -1 ·min -1 ), and faster load carriage (49.9s) was observed in EXP than CON, but no difference in body composition.

210,32345561,Comparison of efficacy nebulized fentanyl with intravenous ketorolac for renal colic in patients over 12 years old.,"OBJECTIVES


Acute renal colic is one of the common causes of referral to the hospitals. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of nebulized fentanyl with that of intravenous ketorolac in renal colic patients.
MATERIALS & METHODS


This double-blinded clinical study included 186 patients with acute renal colic who were referred to the emergency department of Besat Hospital, Iran.
PATIENT SELECTION


After selecting patients, according to study inclusion and exclusion criteria, they were divided into 2 groups of 93 using random block allocation method. The patients in the groups were treated with either nebulized fentanyl or intravenous ketorolac. The severity of pain was measured using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) of pain. The severity of pain at different times and demographic data were recorded.
RESULTS


One hundred and thirty four males and 52 females with a mean age of 42.95 ± 13.13 years were included in the study. The two groups were matched in terms of age, sex, and the severity of the pain before the treatment. Fifteen minutes following the treatment, the severity of pain was decreased in the ketorolac group but did not change in the nebulized fentanyl group. Thirty minutes after the administration of the drug, the severity of pain in the nebulized fentanyl group decreased. At any time, the severity of pain in the ketorolac group was lower than that of the nebulized fentanyl group.
CONCLUSION


Intravenous ketorolac had better analgesic effects in renal colic patients compared with nebulized fentanyl. Further studies that include complications and combinational therapy are required.",2020,"Fifteen minutes following the treatment, the severity of pain was decreased in the ketorolac group but did not change in the nebulized fentanyl group.","['renal colic patients', '13.13\xa0years were included in the study', '186 patients with acute renal colic who were referred to the emergency department of Besat Hospital, Iran', 'renal colic in patients over 12\xa0years old', 'One hundred and thirty four males and 52 females with a mean age of 42.95\xa0±']","['nebulized fentanyl or intravenous ketorolac', 'ketorolac', 'nebulized fentanyl']","['severity of pain', 'analgesic effects', 'Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) of pain']","[{'cui': 'C0152169', 'cui_str': 'Renal colic'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0332257', 'cui_str': 'Including'}, {'cui': 'C0008972', 'cui_str': 'Clinical Study'}, {'cui': 'C1691010', 'cui_str': 'Referral placed'}, {'cui': 'C0562508', 'cui_str': 'Accident and Emergency department'}, {'cui': 'C0019994', 'cui_str': 'Hospitals'}, {'cui': 'C0022065', 'cui_str': 'Iran'}, {'cui': 'C0580836', 'cui_str': 'Old'}, {'cui': 'C4517565', 'cui_str': '134'}, {'cui': 'C0086582', 'cui_str': 'Male'}, {'cui': 'C0043210', 'cui_str': 'Woman'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}]","[{'cui': 'C0015846', 'cui_str': 'Fentanyl'}, {'cui': 'C0348016', 'cui_str': 'Intravenous'}, {'cui': 'C0073631', 'cui_str': 'Ketorolac'}]","[{'cui': 'C0439793', 'cui_str': 'Severities'}, {'cui': 'C0030193', 'cui_str': 'Pain'}, {'cui': 'C0948482', 'cui_str': 'Analgesic effect'}, {'cui': 'C0237753', 'cui_str': 'Number'}, {'cui': 'C0175659', 'cui_str': 'Scale'}]",186.0,0.0229532,"Fifteen minutes following the treatment, the severity of pain was decreased in the ketorolac group but did not change in the nebulized fentanyl group.","[{'ForeName': 'Bareza', 'Initials': 'B', 'LastName': 'Rezaei', 'Affiliation': 'Clinical Research Development Center of Taleghani, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran.'}, {'ForeName': 'Rasoul', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Salimi', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Emergency Medicine, School of Medicine, Besat Hospital, Hamedan University of Medical Sciences, Hamedan, Iran.

211,32345650,Using the BRAVO Risk Engine to Predict Cardiovascular Outcomes in Clinical Trials With Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors.,"OBJECTIVE


This study evaluated the ability of the Building, Relating, Assessing, and Validating Outcomes (BRAVO) risk engine to accurately project cardiovascular outcomes in three major clinical trials-BI 10773 (Empagliflozin) Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS), and Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (DECLARE-TIMI 58) trial-on sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) to treat patients with type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS


Baseline data from the publications of the three trials were obtained and entered into the BRAVO model to predict cardiovascular outcomes. Projected benefits of reducing risk factors of interest (A1C, systolic blood pressure [SBP], LDL, or BMI) on cardiovascular events were evaluated, and simulated outcomes were compared with those observed in each trial.
RESULTS


BRAVO achieved the best prediction accuracy when simulating outcomes of the CANVAS and DECLARE-TIMI 58 trials. For the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, a mild bias was observed (∼20%) in the prediction of mortality and angina. The effect of risk reduction on outcomes in treatment versus placebo groups predicted by the BRAVO model strongly correlated with the observed effect of risk reduction on the trial outcomes as published. Finally, the BRAVO engine revealed that most of the clinical benefits associated with SGLT2i treatment are through A1C control, although reductions in SBP and BMI explain a proportion of the observed decline in cardiovascular events.
CONCLUSIONS


The BRAVO risk engine was effective in predicting the benefits of SGLT2is on cardiovascular health through improvements in commonly measured risk factors, including A1C, SBP, and BMI. Since these benefits are individually small, the use of the complex, dynamic BRAVO model is ideal to explain the cardiovascular outcome trial results.",2020,"The BRAVO risk engine was effective in predicting the benefits of SGLT2is on cardiovascular health through improvements in commonly measured risk factors, including A1C, SBP, and BMI.","['patients with type 2 diabetes', 'Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME']","['BI 10773 (Empagliflozin', 'placebo', 'sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is']","['mortality and angina', 'Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS), and Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction', 'A1C, SBP, and BMI', 'risk factors of interest (A1C, systolic blood pressure [SBP], LDL, or BMI) on cardiovascular events']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0332307', 'cui_str': 'Type - attribute'}, {'cui': 'C0011860', 'cui_str': 'Type 2 diabetes mellitus'}, {'cui': 'C0208940', 'cui_str': 'REG1A protein, human'}, {'cui': 'C1274040', 'cui_str': 'Result'}]","[{'cui': 'C3490349', 'cui_str': 'BI 10773'}, {'cui': 'C3490348', 'cui_str': 'empagliflozin'}, {'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}, {'cui': 'C0017739', 'cui_str': 'Glucose-Sodium Transport System'}, {'cui': 'C0243077', 'cui_str': 'inhibitors'}]","[{'cui': 'C0026565', 'cui_str': 'Mortality rate'}, {'cui': 'C0002962', 'cui_str': 'Angina pectoris'}, {'cui': 'C2974540', 'cui_str': 'canagliflozin'}, {'cui': 'C0007226', 'cui_str': 'Structure of cardiovascular system'}, {'cui': 'C0031809', 'cui_str': 'Physical examination'}, {'cui': 'C0008972', 'cui_str': 'Clinical Study'}, {'cui': 'C2353951', 'cui_str': 'dapagliflozin'}, {'cui': 'C1280500', 'cui_str': 'Effect'}, {'cui': 'C1320716', 'cui_str': 'Cardiovascular event'}, {'cui': 'C0520997', 'cui_str': 'Thrombolysis'}, {'cui': 'C0027051', 'cui_str': 'Myocardial infarction'}, {'cui': 'C4521595', 'cui_str': 'US Military enlisted E3'}, {'cui': 'C0085805', 'cui_str': 'Androgen Binding Protein'}, {'cui': 'C0005893', 'cui_str': 'Body mass index'}, {'cui': 'C0035648', 'cui_str': 'Risk factor'}, {'cui': 'C0543488', 'cui_str': 'Interested'}, {'cui': 'C0871470', 'cui_str': 'Systolic blood pressure'}, {'cui': 'C0023169', 'cui_str': 'LDL(1)'}]",,0.0433696,"The BRAVO risk engine was effective in predicting the benefits of SGLT2is on cardiovascular health through improvements in commonly measured risk factors, including A1C, SBP, and BMI.","[{'ForeName': 'Hui', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Shao', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy, University of Florida College of Pharmacy, Gainesville, FL.'}, {'ForeName': 'Lizheng', 'Initials': 'L', 'LastName': 'Shi', 'Affiliation': 'Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, New Orleans, LA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Vivian A', 'Initials': 'VA', 'LastName': 'Fonseca', 'Affiliation': 'Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA vfonseca@tulane.edu.'}]",Diabetes care,['10.2337/dc20-0227']
212,32345653,Screening and Treatment Outcomes in Adults and Children With Type 1 Diabetes and Asymptomatic Celiac Disease: The CD-DIET Study.,"OBJECTIVE


To describe celiac disease (CD) screening rates and glycemic outcomes of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in patients with type 1 diabetes who are asymptomatic for CD.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS


Asymptomatic patients (8-45 years) were screened for CD. Biopsy-confirmed CD participants were randomized to GFD or gluten-containing diet (GCD) to assess changes in HbA 1c  and continuous glucose monitoring over 12 months.
RESULTS


Adults had higher CD-seropositivity rates than children (6.8% [95% CI 4.9-8.2%,  N  = 1,298] vs. 4.7% [95% CI 3.4-5.9%,  N  = 1,089],  P  = 0.035) with lower rates of prior CD screening (6.9% vs. 44.2%,  P  < 0.0001). Fifty-one participants were randomized to a GFD ( N  = 27) or GCD ( N  = 24). No HbA 1c  differences were seen between the groups (+0.14%, 1.5 mmol/mol; 95% CI -0.79 to 1.08;  P  = 0.76), although greater postprandial glucose increases (4-h +1.5 mmol/L; 95% CI 0.4-2.7;  P  = 0.014) emerged with a GFD.

213,32345685,A Triadic Intervention for Adolescent Sexual Health: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"OBJECTIVES


In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of Families Talking Together (FTT), a triadic intervention to reduce adolescent sexual risk behavior.
METHODS


Adolescents aged 11 to 14 and their female caregivers were recruited from a pediatric clinic; 900 families were enrolled; 84 declined. Families were randomly assigned to FTT or 1 of 2 control conditions. The FTT triadic intervention consisted of a 45-minute face-to-face session for mothers, health care provider endorsement of intervention content, printed materials for families, and a booster call for mothers. The primary outcomes were ever having had vaginal intercourse, sexual debut within the past 12 months, and condom use at last sexual intercourse. Assessments occurred at baseline, 3 months post baseline, and 12 months post baseline.
RESULTS


Of enrolled families, 73.4% identified as Hispanic, 20.4% as African American, and 6.2% as mixed race. Mean maternal age was 38.8 years, and mean adolescent grade was seventh grade. At the 12-month follow-up, 5.2% of adolescents in the experimental group reported having had sexual intercourse, compared with 18% of adolescents in the control groups ( P  < .05). In the experimental group, 4.7% of adolescents reported sexual debut within the past 12 months, compared with 14.7% of adolescents in the control group ( P  < .05).

214,31799875,Assessment of Response to Neoadjuvant Therapy Using CT Texture Analysis in Patients With Resectable and Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.,"OBJECTIVE.  The goal of this study was to assess the correlation between CT-derived texture features of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and histologic and biochemical markers of response to neoadjuvant treatment as well as disease-free survival in patients with potentially resectable PDAC.  SUBJECTS AND METHODS.  Thirty-nine patients completed this prospective study protocol between November 2013 and December 2016. All patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, underwent surgical resection, and had histologic grading of tumor response. Similar CT protocol was used for all patients. Pancreatic (late arterial) phase of pre- and posttreatment CT scans were evaluated. Histogram analysis and spatial-band-pass filtration were used to extract textural features. Correlation between textural parameters, histologic response, biochemical response, and genetic mutations was assessed using Mann-Whitney test, chi-square analysis, and multivariate logistic regression. Association with disease-free survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox model.  RESULTS.  Pretreatment mean positive pixel (MPP) at fine- and medium-level filtration, pretreatment kurtosis at medium-level filtration, changes in kurtosis, and pretreatment tumor SD were statistically different between patients with no or poor histologic response and favorable histologic response ( p  < 0.05). Changes in skewness and kurtosis at medium-level filtration significantly correlated with biochemical response ( p  < 0.01). On the basis of multivariate analysis, patients with higher MPP at pretreatment CT were more likely to have favorable histologic response (odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.002-1.12). The Cox model for association between textural features and disease-free survival was statistically significant ( p  = 0.001).  CONCLUSION.  Textural features extracted from baseline pancreatic phase CT imaging of patients with potentially resectable PDAC and longitudinal changes in tumor heterogeneity can be used as biomarkers for predicting histologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and disease-free survival.",2020,Changes in skewness and kurtosis at medium-level filtration significantly correlated with biochemical

215,31804779,Impact of pretreatment interhemispheric hippocampal asymmetry on improvement in verbal learning following erythropoietin treatment in mood disorders: a randomized controlled trial,"Background


Treatment development that targets cognitive impairment is hampered by a lack of biomarkers that can predict treatment efficacy. Erythropoietin (EPO) improves verbal learning and memory in mood disorders, and this scales with an increase in left hippocampal volume. This study investigated whether pretreatment left hippocampal volume, interhemisphere hippocampal asymmetry or both influenced EPO treatment response with respect to verbal learning.
Methods


Data were available for 76 of 83 patients with mood disorders from our previous EPO trials (EPO = 37 patients; placebo = 39 patients). We performed cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation using FreeSurfer. We conducted multiple linear regression and logistic regression to assess the influence of left hippocampal volume and hippocampal asymmetry on EPO-related memory improvement, as reflected by change in Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test total recall from baseline to post-treatment. We set up a corresponding exploratory general linear model in FreeSurfer to assess the influence of prefrontal cortex volume on verbal learning improvement, controlling for age, sex and total intracranial volume.
Results


At baseline, more rightward (left < right) hippocampal asymmetry — but not left hippocampal volume per se — was associated with greater effects of EPO versus placebo on verbal learning (p ≤ 0.05). Exploratory analysis indicated that a larger left precentral gyrus surface area was also associated with improvement of verbal learning in the EPO group compared to the placebo group (p = 0.002).
Limitations


This was a secondary analysis of our original EPO trials.
Conclusion


Rightward hippocampal asymmetry may convey a positive effect of EPO treatment efficacy on verbal learning.

217,31819393,Positive Expiratory Pressure Therapy With And Without Oscillation And Hospital Length Of Stay For Acute Exacerbation Of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.,"Introduction


Pharmacologic management of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is well-established. Our aim in the current study is to determine if therapy with a positive expiratory pressure (PEP) device with or without an oscillatory mechanism (OM) in addition to standard care results in a reduction in hospital length of stay (LOS) among patients hospitalized for AECOPD.
Methods


Two studies were performed and are reported here. Study 1: Patients admitted with AECOPD and sputum production were enrolled in a prospective trial comparing PEP therapy versus Oscillatory PEP (OPEP) therapy. Study 2: A retrospective historical cohort, matched in a 2 to 1 manner by age, gender, and season of admission, was compared with the prospectively collected data to determine the effect of PEP ± OM versus standard care on hospital LOS.
Results


In the prospective trial (Study 1; 91 subjects), median hospital LOS was 3.2 (95% CI 3.0-4.3) days in the OPEP group and 4.8 (95% CI 3.9-6.1) days in the PEP group (p=0.16). In fully adjusted models comparing the prospective trial data with the retrospective cohort (Study 2; 182 subjects), cases had a median hospital LOS of 4.2 days (95% CI 3.8-5.1) versus 5.2 days (95% CI 4.4-6.0) in controls, consistent with a shorter hospital LOS with adjunctive PEP±OM therapy versus standard care (p=0.04).
Conclusion


Adjunctive therapy with a PEP device versus standard care may reduce hospital LOS in patients admitted for AECOPD. Although the addition of an OM component to PEP therapy suggests a further reduction in hospital LOS, comprehensive multicenter randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

218,32346648,"Electronic Monitoring Of Mom's Schedule (eMOMS™): Protocol for a feasibility randomized controlled trial to improve postpartum weight, blood sugars, and breastfeeding among high BMI women.","Background


Overweight and obesity are major risk factors for gestational diabetes among U.S. women. Evidence suggests that longer duration of breastfeeding among women with a history of gestational diabetes is associated with lower incidence of developing type 2 diabetes after pregnancy. Women may potentially benefit from a lifestyle change program that includes breastfeeding education and support.
Purpose


To describe the design and justification of a combined breastfeeding, national Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)-based feasibility randomized controlled trial, the electronic Monitoring Of Mom's Schedule (eMOMS TM ) study. eMOMS TM  compares the feasibility and efficacy of three interventions on six-month postpartum weight loss among women with a BMI ≥25.
Methods


The intervention is delivered via Facebook and includes three groups: DPP and breastfeeding (eMOMS1); DPP only (eMOMS2); and Usual Care (eMOMS3). Recruitment is ongoing at two clinical sites (rural and urban). A total of 72 women, 24 per group, will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups. It is anticipated that women in eMOMS1 will have greater weight loss and increased length of breastfeeding at three and six months postpartum compared to women in eMOMS2 and eMOMS3. Additional data will be collected on metabolic markers, anthropometrics, physical activity, nutrition, breastfeeding, and depression. Program cost will be compared to that of traditionally scheduled group meetings. Expected study completion date: October 2021.
Conclusions


This study has the potential to define a high impact, cost effective intervention that can improve public health by reducing negative health outcomes associated with gestational diabetes among an at-risk population.",2020,"This study has the potential to define a high impact, cost effective intervention that can improve public health by reducing negative health outcomes associated with gestational diabetes among an at-risk population.","['women with a history of gestational diabetes', 'A total of 72 women, 24 per group', 'gestational diabetes among U.S. women', 'women with a BMI ≥25', 'high BMI women']","[""Electronic Monitoring Of Mom's Schedule (eMOMS™"", 'DPP and breastfeeding (eMOMS1); DPP only (eMOMS2); and Usual Care (eMOMS3']","['weight loss and increased length of breastfeeding', 'metabolic markers, anthropometrics, physical activity, nutrition, breastfeeding, and depression']","[{'cui': 'C0043210', 'cui_str': 'Woman'}, {'cui': 'C0262926', 'cui_str': 'History of'}, {'cui': 'C0439671', 'cui_str': 'Gestational'}, {'cui': 'C0439810', 'cui_str': 'Total'}, {'cui': 'C0439745', 'cui_str': 'Grouped'}, {'cui': 'C0005893', 'cui_str': 'Body mass index'}, {'cui': 'C0205250', 'cui_str': 'High'}]","[{'cui': 'C0336646', 'cui_str': 'Electronic monitor'}, {'cui': 'C1442163', 'cui_str': 'MoM'}, {'cui': 'C0035008', 'cui_str': 'Reinforcement Schedule'}, {'cui': 'C0011849', 'cui_str': 'Diabetes mellitus'}, {'cui': 'C0199176', 'cui_str': 'Preventive procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0018106', 'cui_str': 'Government Programs'}, {'cui': 'C0006147', 'cui_str': 'Breast fed'}]","[{'cui': 'C1262477', 'cui_str': 'Weight decreased'}, {'cui': 'C0205217', 'cui_str': 'Increased'}, {'cui': 'C1444754', 'cui_str': 'Length'}, {'cui': 'C0006147', 'cui_str': 'Breast fed'}, {'cui': 'C1513159', 'cui_str': 'Metabolic marker'}, {'cui': 'C0015259', 'cui_str': 'Exercise'}, {'cui': 'C0028707', 'cui_str': 'Nutrition Sciences'}, {'cui': 'C0011570', 'cui_str': 'Depression'}]",72.0,0.0796669,"This study has the potential to define a high impact, cost effective intervention that can improve public health by reducing negative health outcomes associated with gestational diabetes among an at-risk population.","[{'ForeName': 'Lisette T', 'Initials': 'LT', 'LastName': 'Jacobson', 'Affiliation': 'University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita, Department of Population Health, 1010 North Kansas, Wichita, KS, 67214, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Tracie C', 'Initials': 'TC', 'LastName': 'Collins', 'Affiliation': 'University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita, Department of Population Health, 1010 North Kansas, Wichita, KS, 67214, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Meredith', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Lucas', 'Affiliation': 'University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita, Department of Population Health, 1010 North Kansas, Wichita, KS, 67214, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Rosey', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Zackula', 'Affiliation': 'University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita, Office of Research, 1010 North Kansas, Wichita, KS, 67214, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Hayrettin', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Okut', 'Affiliation': 'University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita, Office of Research, 1010 North Kansas, Wichita, KS, 67214, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Niaman', 'Initials': 'N', 'LastName': 'Nazir', 'Affiliation': 'University of Kansas School of Medicine-Kansas City, Department of Population Health, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Mailstop 1003, Kansas City, KS, 66160, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'David', 'Initials': 'D', 'LastName': 'Robbins', 'Affiliation': 'University of Kansas Medical Center-Kansas City, Diabetes Institute, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Mailstop 1064, Kansas City, KS, 66160, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Judy E', 'Initials': 'JE', 'LastName': 'Stern', 'Affiliation': 'Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and the Geisel School of Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, One Medical Center Drive, Lebanon, NH, 03756, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Michael', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Wolfe', 'Affiliation': 'Ascension Via Christi Hospitals Wichita, Inc., Ascension Via Christi Maternal Fetal Medicine Clinic, 1515 South Clifton Avenue, Suite 130, Wichita, KS, 67218, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'David A', 'Initials': 'DA', 'LastName': 'Grainger', 'Affiliation': 'University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 1010 North Kansas, Wichita, KS, 67214, USA.'}]",Contemporary clinical trials communications,['10.1016/j.conctc.2020.100565']
219,32346686,"Clinical Research of the Application of Bone Turnover Markers in Monitoring the Short-Term Therapeutic Efficacy of Vitamin D in Postmenopausal Osteoporotic women in Harbin, China.","BACKGROUND


The incidence of osteoporosis (OP) is increasing year by year. researches have shown that there was an intense link between the vitamin D (VitD) status and the efficacy of zoledronate (ZOL) in patients with osteoporosis. Since VitD is related to the geogen, its promotion effect on zoledronate has regional specificity.
AIM


Combining dual-energy X-ray and bone turnover markers (BTM) to explore the VitD level in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients in Harbin and monitor its effect on the anti-osteoporosis effect of ZOL.
METHODS


A total of 120 patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) were enrolled .These patients were divided into two groups with 25(OH)D levels = 10ng/ml as a critical point, and each group was randomly divided into experimental groups and control groups). All of the patients were conducted 5 mg ZOL. Then the experimental group was given calcitriol and calcium carbonate, and the control group was only given calcium carbonate. BTM were measured at baseline, 24h, 3 months and 6 months. We also measured bone mineral density (BMD) of bilateral hips (TH BMD) and lumbar spine (LS BMD) at baseline and 6 months.
RESULTS


The VitD deficiency rates of the patients enrolled were 84.1%. There was an inverse relationship between the baseline level of VitD and the serum levels of P1NP / β-CTX, (r=-0.452,p=0.00; r=-0.225, p=0.01). Comparing with baseline, the level of serum P1NP,β-CTX in each group declined significantly after the treatment (P<0.05). The mean decreasing rates of P1NP and β-CTX in the both experimental groups were significantly higher than that of the corresponding control groups at the same time point (P<0.05), after 6 months of medication. Both TH BMD and LS BMD at 6 months increased significantly. The increase rate of LS BMD in the high VitD experimental group was significantly higher than the other three groups (P<0.05), the increase rates of TH BMD in the low VitD control group were significantly lower than the other three groups (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS


The levels of serum VitD in the patients enrolled in this study were generally low.

220,32346706,[Evaluation of continuous curvilinear buccal-cervical incision in combined radical resection of buccal cancer].,"PURPOSE


To evaluate the clinical effect of continuous curvilinear buccal-cervical incision in combined radical resection of buccal cancer.
METHODS


From January 2015 to December 2018, a total of 87 patients with buccal cancer were collected, of whom 42 underwent continuous curvilinear buccal-cervical incision (experimental group) and 45 underwent conventional cervical T shaped incision combined with a buccal incision (control group). Exposure of surgical filed in two groups was evaluated. The length of incision, duration of radical resection, and the incidence of postoperative complications were compared between two groups. The patients were followed-up for 7-43 months. Modified vancouver scar scale (VSS) and University of Washington Quality of Life (UW-QOL) were used to evaluate the postoperative scar and quality of life in both groups. Statistical analysis was performed on the data using SPSS 22.0 software package.
RESULTS


The length of the incision in the experimental group was (36.40±5.08) cm, which was shorter than that of the control group (39.93±5.22) cm. Duration of combined radical resection in the experimental group was shorter than that of the control group. The incidence of neck complications in the experimental group was lower than that of the control group. The postoperative scar assessment and quality of life of the experimental group were better than that of the control group. The difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the exposure of the surgical field, postoperative recurrence and metastasis rate.
CONCLUSIONS


Continuous curvilinear buccal-cervical incision has good exposure of the surgical field and shorter duration of radical resection, which ensures en bloc resection of tumor and cervical lymph nodes. It limits the formation of skin cicatrix, reduces the occurrence of postoperative complications and results in a good aesthetic and functional effect, therefore it is a recommended incision for clinical practice.",2019,"There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the exposure of the surgical field, postoperative recurrence and metastasis rate.

To observe the effects of immediate implantation combined with high-speed turbine minimally invasive technology and traditional technology on postoperative analgesia, mouth opening and alveolar bone resorption after removal of complex impacted teeth.
METHODS


Eighty patients with impacted teeth treated in our hospital from January 2014 to December 2018 were randomly divided into 2 groups: experimental group and control group with 40 cases in each group. Patients in the experimental group were treated with high-speed turbine minimally invasive surgery combined with immediate implantation, while patients in the control group were treated with traditional surgery combined with immediate implantation. Differences in alveolar bone resorption, pain, swelling, limited mouth opening, intact extraction socket and complications were compared between the two groups. SPSS 19.0 software package was used to perform statistical analysis.
RESULTS


Three months after operation, the implant height of the maxillary anterior teeth, maxillary molar, mandibular anterior teeth and mandibular molar areas in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in the control group. One day after operation, the VAS score of the experimental group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P<0.05). Three months after operation,there was no significant difference in VAS score between the two groups (P>0.05); but intact extraction socket, swelling degree and mouth opening limitation of the experimental group were significantly lower than those of the control group.

222,32346886,Predictors of genetic testing uptake in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES


Many newly diagnosed breast cancer patients do not receive genetic counseling and testing at the time of diagnosis. We examined predictors of genetic testing (GT) in this population.
METHODS


Within a randomized controlled trial of proactive rapid genetic counseling and testing vs usual care, patients completed a baseline survey within 6 weeks of breast cancer diagnosis but before a definitive survey. We conducted a multinomial logistic regression to identify predictors of GT timing/uptake.
RESULTS


Having discussed GT with a surgeon was a dominant predictor (χ 2  (2, N = 320) = 70.13; P < .0001). Among those who discussed GT with a surgeon, patients who had made a final surgery decision were less likely to receive GT before surgery compared with postsurgically (OR [odds ratio] = 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.12-0.49) or no testing (OR = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.14-0.56). Older patients (OR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.91-0.99) and participants enrolled in New York/New Jersey (OR = 0.22; 95% CI = 0.07-0.72) were less likely to be tested compared with receiving results before surgery. Those with higher perceived risk (OR = 1.02; 95% CI = 1.00-1.03) were more likely to receive results before surgery than to not be tested.
CONCLUSIONS


This study highlights the role of patient-physician communication about GT as well as patient-level factors that predict presurgical GT.",2020,"Those with higher perceived risk (OR = 1.02; 95% CI = 1.00-1.03) were more likely to receive results before surgery than to not be tested.

223,32346890,Precision dosing-based optimisation of paroxetine during pregnancy for poor and ultrarapid CYP2D6 metabolisers: a virtual clinical trial pharmacokinetics study.,"BACKGROUND


Paroxetine has been demonstrated to undergo gestation-related reductions in plasma concentrations, to an extent which is dictated by the polymorphic state of CYP 2D6. However, knowledge of appropriate dose titrations is lacking.
METHODS


A pharmacokinetic modelling approach was applied to examine gestational changes in trough plasma concentrations for CYP 2D6 phenotypes, followed by necessary dose adjustment strategies to maintain paroxetine levels within a therapeutic range of 20-60 ng/ml.
KEY FINDINGS


A decrease in trough plasma concentrations was simulated throughout gestation for all phenotypes. A significant number of ultrarapid (UM) phenotype subjects possessed trough levels below 20 ng/ml (73-76%) compared to extensive metabolisers (EM) (51-53%).
CONCLUSIONS


For all phenotypes studied, there was a requirement for daily doses in excess of the standard 20 mg dose throughout gestation. For EM, a dose of 30 mg daily in trimester 1 followed by 40 mg daily in trimesters 2 and 3 is suggested to be optimal. For poor metabolisers (PM), a 20 mg daily dose in trimester 1 followed by 30 mg daily in trimesters 2 and 3 is suggested to be optimal. For UM, a 40 mg daily dose throughout gestation is suggested to be optimal.",2020,A decrease in trough plasma concentrations was simulated throughout gestation for all phenotypes.,[],"['Paroxetine', 'paroxetine']",['trough plasma concentrations'],[],"[{'cui': 'C0070122', 'cui_str': 'Paroxetine'}]","[{'cui': 'C0444506', 'cui_str': 'Trough'}, {'cui': 'C0032105', 'cui_str': 'blood plasma'}, {'cui': 'C0004268', 'cui_str': 'Attention'}]",,0.0738364,A decrease in trough plasma concentrations was simulated throughout gestation for all phenotypes.,"[{'ForeName': 'Aminah', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Almurjan', 'Affiliation': 'Medicines Optimisation Research Group, Aston Pharmacy School, Aston University, Birmingham, UK.'}, {'ForeName': 'Hannah', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Macfarlane', 'Affiliation': 'Medicines Optimisation Research Group, Aston Pharmacy School, Aston University, Birmingham, UK.'}, {'ForeName': 'Raj K S', 'Initials': 'RKS', 'LastName': 'Badhan', 'Affiliation': 'Medicines Optimisation Research Group, Aston Pharmacy School, Aston University, Birmingham, UK.'}]",The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,['10.1111/jphp.13281']
224,32346896,Effects of Virtual Reality on Moods in Community Older Adults. A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.,"INTRODUCTION


Virtual-reality (VR) technology is a potential method to use in cognitive intervention, but the use of VR in cognitive stimulation intervention for older adults has not been investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the mood change of older adults after participating in the VR cognitive stimulation activity.
METHODS


This is a multicenter randomized controlled, cross-over trial. The intervention was a VR cognitive stimulation activity, and the control was a paper-and-pencil activity. The participants were older adults with age over 60 and recruited in the elderly community centres. The Positive and Negative Affect Score (PANAS) was used to measure mood change. Mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated. The Simulator sickness questionnaire was used to measure adverse events.
RESULTS


A total of 236 participants from 19 community centres were recruited. After the VR activity, the participants had a significant increase in total PANAS positive affect score (MD = 2.09, 95% CI = 0.69 to 3.49), and a significant reduction in total negative affect score (MD = -1.99, 95% CI = -2.55 to -1.43). The reduction in negative affect score was significantly larger in VR activity than paper-and-pencil activity (MD = -0.48, 95% CI = -0.98 to 0.00). Besides, only 3 participants reported severe advance events after VR activity.
CONCLUSIONS


The use of VR technology is well accepted by older adults. Therefore, the use of VR technology through smartphone and a mobile app can be a potential method for future cognitive training interventions. This article is protected by copyright.

Combining these two may optimize their efficacy and minimize safety concerns. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of a fixed combination of TAZ 0.05% and betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% (BM) for psoriasis vulgaris. A multicenter, randomized, single-blinded, controlled phase 3 clinical trial was conducted. A total of 600 Chinese subjects with psoriasis vulgaris were randomized (3:1:1) to TAZ/BM cream, TAZ gel or BM cream groups for 6 weeks with an 8-week follow up. The primary efficacy assessment end-point was 75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-75) at 6 weeks. Secondary outcome assessments included PASI-90, percentage of PASI decrease and so forth. Safety and treatment-related adverse events were monitored throughout the study. Our results demonstrated that the TAZ/BM group exhibited statistically significant superiority in PASI-75 over TAZ (6.74% vs 1.67%) within 2 weeks. After 6 weeks of treatment, PASI-75 was 44.94% in the TAZ/BM group while 19.17% and 35.00% in the TAZ and BM group, respectively. At the 8-week follow up, the relapse rate of the TAZ/BM group was significantly lower than the BM group (10.62% vs 29.63%, P = 0.0269) though comparable with the TAZ group (10.00%). The most frequently reported treatment-related adverse event was mild to moderate level of skin irritation events. TAZ/BM combination has significant advantages over TAZ, including satisfying efficacy, rapid onset and reduced local stimulation. Meanwhile, compared with BM, it has the advantages of longer relief time and reduced clinical relapse rate.

227,32347216,Grinding the intaglio surface of yttria partially- and fully-stabilized zirconia polycrystals restorations: Effect on their fatigue behavior.,"This study evaluated the effects of diamond bur grinding the intaglio surface of second (yttria partially-stabilized zirconia polycrystals, PSZ) and third-generation zirconia (fully-stabilized zirconia polycrystals, FSZ) adhesively cemented to dentin analogue substrate on the fatigue failure load, cycle number until failure, surface micromorphology and phase transformation. Disc-shaped specimens were produced from second (Katana ML-HT, Kuraray) and third-generation zirconia (Katana STML, Kuraray) and randomly allocated (n = 15) into two groups according to the intaglio surface treatment: Control - Ctrl (without grinding); Grinding - Gr (grinding at the center of the intaglio surface). The ceramic discs were adhesively cemented (Multilink Automix System) onto dentin analogue discs. Fatigue tests were executed by the step-stress method. The obtained data were analyzed by Kaplan Meier and Mantel-Cox tests. In addition, surface topography, roughness, phase transformation and fractography analyses were performed.

In this prospective, randomized, parallel design, placebo controlled study, thirty-one men with prostate cancer consumed daily 1 gram of GTE (830 mg of GTP) with 800 mg of Q (GT + Q) or placebo (GT + PL) for four weeks before prostatectomy. First morning voided urine was collected at baseline, 3 weeks and the day of surgery, and prostate tissue on the day of surgery. In week 3, plasma concentration of GTPs and Q was measured in blood collected before and 2 hours after the morning dose. Prostate tissue epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and epicatechin gallate (ECG) were detected in 67 and 93% of participants in the GT + Q group and 75 and 94% of participants in the GT + PL group. Q was increased 14-fold, 12-fold and 4.5-fold in plasma, urine, and prostate tissue, respectively, in the GT + Q compared to the GT + PL-group. There was a trend for decreased EGC levels in urine collected prior to prostatectomy in the GT + Q compared to GT + PL-group (p = 0.053). Plasma epigallocatechin (EGC) showed a trend to increase (p = 0.066) two hours after capsule intake in the GT + Q vs. the GT + PL-group.

229,32347365,Intraoperative radiotherapy for resectable advanced lower rectal cancer-final results of a randomized controlled trial (UMIN000021353).,"AIM


Pelvic autonomic nerve preservation (PANP) is useful to preserve voiding and sexual function after rectal cancer surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the benefit of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) to have complete PANP without affecting oncological outcomes.
METHODS


Patients undergoing potentially curative resection of the rectum were included. They were randomized to intraoperative radiotherapy of the completely preserved bilateral pelvic nerve plexuses (IORT group) or the control group without IORT, but with limited nerve preservation. The primary endpoint was pelvic sidewall recurrence. Moreover, patients' clinicopathologic parameters, postoperative complications, voiding function, and other oncologic outcomes were compared.
RESULTS


From 79 patients, three were excluded from analysis, resulting in 38 patients in each group. Patients' demographic and pathological parameters were well balanced between the two groups. The trial was terminated prematurely in July 2017, because distant metastasis-free survivals were found to be significantly worse in the IORT group compared to the control group (odds ratio 2.554; 95% CI, 1.041 ~ 6.269; p = 0.041). Neither overall survival nor pelvic sidewall recurrence did differ between the two groups (overall survival: odds ratio 1.264; 95% CI, 0.523~3.051; p = 0.603/pelvic sidewall recurrence; odds ratio 1.350; 95% CI, 0.302~6.034; p = 0.694). Postoperative complications did not differ between the groups; however, the urinary function was significantly better in the IORT group in the short and long term.
CONCLUSION


With the aid of IORT, complete PANP can be done without increase of pelvic sidewall recurrence; however, IORT may increase the incidence of distant metastases. Therefore, IORT cannot be recommended as a standard therapy to compensate less radical resection for advanced lower rectal cancer.",2020,"Postoperative complications did not differ between the groups; however, the urinary function was significantly better in the IORT group in the short and long term.

231,32345990,Effects of β 2 -receptor stimulation by indacaterol in chronic heart failure treated with selective or non-selective β-blockers: a randomized trial.,"Alveolar β 2 -receptor blockade worsens lung diffusion in heart failure (HF). This effect could be mitigated by stimulating alveolar β 2 -receptors. We investigated the safety and the effects of indacaterol on lung diffusion, lung mechanics, sleep respiratory behavior, cardiac rhythm, welfare, and exercise performance in HF patients treated with a selective (bisoprolol) or a non-selective (carvedilol) β-blocker. Study procedures were performed before and after indacaterol and placebo treatments according to a cross-over, randomized, double-blind protocol in forty-four patients (27 on bisoprolol and 17 on carvedilol).

232,32346165,"A prospective, randomised, comparative study to evaluate long axis, short axis and medial oblique axis approach for ultrasound-guided internal jugular vein cannulation.","Background and Aims


The Ultrasound (USG)-guided internal jugular vein (IJV) cannulation can be performed using different approaches like short axis (SAX), long axis (LAX), oblique axis (OAX) or medial oblique axis (M-OAX). We aimed to determine which view was optimal for IJV cannulation.
Methods


After ethical committee approval and written informed consent, this prospective, randomised, controlled trial was conducted on 108 patients. Patients were allocated into one of the three groups: A (SAX), B (LAX) and C (M-OAX approach) for USG-guided IJV cannulation. The number of needle passes, the success of IJV cannulation and its diameter, venous access time, guidewire time, catheterisation time and complications if any were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS version 17.0.
Results


First needle pass success rate was highest in M-OAX (97.2%) followed by SAX (88.9%) and then LAX (77.8%) but it was statistically insignificant among the groups. Mean venous access, guidewire insertion and catheterisation time were shortest in M-OAX followed by SAX and then LAX approach. It was statistically significant between LAX and SAX and between LAX and M-OAX group. ( P  < 0.001). The carotid puncture was noticed in two patients in the LAX group. The overall success rate and the number of needle passes were comparable among the groups.

233,32346166,Comparison of cross-legged sitting position with the traditional sitting position for the ease of insertion of an epidural catheter in parturient for providing labour analgesia: A randomised control trial.,"Background and Aims


The patient's position during the insertion of the epidural catheter plays a major role in the success of labour analgesia. In our study, we compared the ease of insertion of the epidural catheter in either traditional sitting position (TSP) or crossed-legged sitting position (CLSP). The primary objective was to compare the number of successful first attempts at epidural placement between the groups. Secondary objective included patient comfort, ease of landmark palpation and the number of needle-bone contacts.
Methods


The prospective non-blinded randomised control study was conducted on 50 parturient with uncomplicated pregnancy during active labour. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups using a computer-generated random sequence of numbers by closed envelope technique. Group TSP received epidural in a traditional sitting position and group CLSP received an epidural in a crossed-legged sitting position with knee and hip flexed.
Results


The parturient in both groups were comparable with respect to the distribution of age, height, weight and parity. The baseline visual analogue score (VAS) and VAS scores at 15 min were comparable between groups. Percentage of a parturient with successful epidural placement in the first attempt was higher in CLSP group than in TSP group (88% versus 44%,  P  = 0.004). The landmark, needle-bone contact and comfort during positioning were comparable between the two groups.

The proportion of patients undergoing living donor liver transplantation is high especially in countries without or with limited cadaver organ sharing programs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the post-hepatectomy effect of using N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) infusion in living donors undergoing donor hepatectomy.
Methods


In a prospective randomised non-blinded study, 50 healthy donors were enrolled; following hepatectomy patients were randomised into 2 groups: Group NC receiving NAC 150 mg/kg diluted in 100 ml glucose 5% over 40 minutes, followed by NAC 12.5 mg/kg in 500 ml glucose 5% over 4 hours. This was followed by NAC 6.25 mg/kg for 2 post-operative days, Group C (Control group) received ringer acetate infusion at same rate for 2 days. The primary outcome was serum lactate levels. Secondary outcomes were liver function tests, serum creatinine and urine output on intensive care unit (ICU) admission (0 hr.), after 24 hours and 48 hours, length of ICU stay.
Results


Our study revealed significant reduction in serum lactate in Group NC at 0, 24 and 48 hours compared to C group ( P  = 0.017, 0.002, 0.014). INR values showed significant reduction after 48 hours in Group NC compared to Group C ( P  = 0.049).

Orthognathic surgery can account for a considerable amount of blood loss since the vascularization of maxillofacial region is such that major bleeding can occur. Intra-bony bleed is often involved as a major aspect of blood loss associated with osteotomies, especially LeFort I osteotomy when performed during orthognathic surgery. This study evolved as a result of the increasing concern to attain a clear surgical field and reduce the duration of surgical procedure and the amount of blood loss associated with orthognathic surgery with the use of controlled hypotension.
Method


Twenty patients planned for undergoing LeFort I osteotomy were randomly allocated into two groups (Group 1-normotensive anesthesia; Group 2-hypotensive anesthesia). The amount of blood loss, mean difference between hemoglobin and hematocrit in the preoperative and postoperative period, and quality of surgical field were evaluated for patients in the two groups.

237,32346235,"A Prospective, Randomized Double-Blinded Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Buffered Local Anesthetics in Infected and Inflamed Pulp and Periapical Tissues.","Aim


The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate as an additive alkalizing agent to local anesthetic solutions in inflamed and infected pulpal and periapical tissues.
Type of Study


A prospective, randomized crossover double-blinded study was carried out in a university-affiliated hospital in Chennai.
Materials and Methods


A randomized crossover double-blinded study was designed wherein ninety-six patients were enrolled for the study. 1.8 ml of 2% lignocaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline was administered. The latency time period was found to be 5-10 min and extraction was attempted. During extraction, if the patient experienced pain, 0.5 ml of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate was injected into the previously injected local anesthesia site. A time period of 3 min was allowed for the alkalinization to occur. Extraction was carried out only when the patient did not complain of pain. Pain score was assessed before and after administration of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate using visual analog scale. Pulse rate at the baseline, before and after administration of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate, was recorded and the pain scale values were correlated with pulse rate.
Results


It was found that there was a significant decrease in pain after injecting buffered local anesthetics ( p  < 0.1). Pain score before injecting sodium bicarbonate was higher when compared to post-injection of sodium bicarbonate. There was also significant reduction in pulse rate following the administration of sodium bicarbonate.
Conclusion


Buffered 2% lignocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine had early onset of anesthesia when compared to unbuffered form.

238,32346327,The application of 3D printing patient specific instrumentation model in total knee arthroplasty.,"The application of 3D printing patient specific instrumentation model in total knee arthroplasty was explored to improve the operative accuracy and safety of artificial total knee arthroplasty. In this study, a total of 52 patients who need knee replacement were selected as the study objects, and 52 patients were divided into experimental group and control group. First, the femoral mechanical-anatomical angle (FMAA), lateral femoral angle (LFA), hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), femorotibial angle (FTA) of research objects in both groups were measured. Then, the blood loss during the operations, drainage volume after operations, total blood loss, hidden blood loss, and hemoglobin decrease of the experiment group and the control group were measured and calculated. Finally, the postoperative outcomes of patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty were evaluated. The results showed that before the operations, in the PSI group, the femoral mechanical-anatomical angle (FMAA) was (6.9 ± 2.4)°, the lateral femoral angle (LFA) was (82.4 ± 1.6)°, the hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA) was (166.4 ± 1.4)°, and the femorotibial angle (FTA) was (179.5 ± 7.3)°. In the CON group, the FMAA was (5.8 ± 2.4)°, the LFA was (81.3 ± 2.1)°, the HKA was (169.5 ± 1.9)°, and the FTA was (185.4 ± 5.4)°. The differences in these data between the two groups were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). After the operations, in the PSI group, the total blood loss, the hidden blood loss, and the hemoglobin (Hb) decrease were respectively (420.2 ± 210.5), (240.5 ± 234.5), and (1.7 ± 0.9); in the CON group, the total blood loss, the hidden blood loss, and the Hb decrease were respectively (782.1 ± 340.4), (450.9 ± 352.6), and (2.9 ± 1.0). These data of both groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Therefore, it can be seen that the 3D printing patient specific instrumentation model can effectively simulate the lower limb coronal force line and was highly consistent of the preoperative software simulation plan. In addition, the random interviews of patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty showed that the knees of patients had recovered well.

240,32346385,Molecular Biomarkers Predictive of Sertraline Treatment Response in Young Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"Sertraline is one among several selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that exhibited improvement of language development in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); however, the molecular mechanism has not been elucidated. A double blind, randomized, 6-month, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of low-dose sertraline in children ages (3-6 years) with ASD was conducted at the UC Davis MIND Institute. It aimed at evaluating the efficacy and benefit with respect to early expressive language development and global clinical improvement. This study aimed to identify molecular biomarkers that might be key players in the serotonin pathway and might be predictive of a clinical response to sertraline. Fifty eight subjects with the diagnosis of ASD were randomized to sertraline or placebo. Eight subjects from the sertraline arm and five from the placebo arm discontinued from the study. Furthermore, four subjects did not have a successful blood draw. Hence, genotypes for 41 subjects (20 on placebo and 21 on sertraline) were determined for several genes involved in the serotonin pathway including the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region ( 5-HTTLPR ), the tryptophan hydroxylase 2 ( TPH2 ), and the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor ( BDNF ). In addition, plasma levels of  BDNF , Matrix metallopeptidase 9 ( MMP-9 ) and a selected panel of cytokines were determined at baseline and post-treatment. Intent-to-treat analysis revealed several primary significant correlations between molecular changes and the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) and Clinical Global Impression Scale - Improvement (CGI-I) of treatment and control groups but they were not significant after adjustment for multiple testing. Thus, sertraline showed no benefit for treatment of young children with ASD in language development or changes in molecular markers in this study. These results indicate that sertraline may not be beneficial for the treatment of children with ASD; however, further investigation of larger groups as well as longer term follow-up studies are warranted.",2020,"Thus, sertraline showed no benefit for treatment of young children with ASD in language development or changes in molecular markers in this study.","['children with ASD', '41 subjects (20 on placebo and 21 on', 'Fifty eight subjects with the diagnosis of ASD', 'Young Children With Autism', 'Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD', 'children ages (3-6 years) with ASD was conducted at the UC Davis MIND Institute']","['Sertraline', 'sertraline or placebo', 'sertraline', 'placebo']","['Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) and Clinical Global Impression Scale - Improvement (CGI-I', 'plasma levels of  BDNF , Matrix metallopeptidase 9 ( MMP-9 ) and a selected panel of cytokines', 'serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region ( 5-HTTLPR ), the tryptophan hydroxylase 2 ( TPH2 ), and the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor ( BDNF ']","[{'cui': 'C0008059', 'cui_str': 'Child'}, {'cui': 'C0524528', 'cui_str': 'Autism spectrum disorder'}, {'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}, {'cui': 'C4517817', 'cui_str': '58'}, {'cui': 'C0011900', 'cui_str': 'Diagnosis'}, {'cui': 'C0337547', 'cui_str': 'Younger child'}, {'cui': 'C0004352', 'cui_str': 'Autistic disorder'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0442759', 'cui_str': '3/6'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0004927', 'cui_str': 'Behavior finding'}, {'cui': 'C0021622', 'cui_str': 'Institutes'}]","[{'cui': 'C0074393', 'cui_str': 'Sertraline'}, {'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}]","[{'cui': 'C0175659', 'cui_str': 'Scale'}, {'cui': 'C1279919', 'cui_str': 'Early'}, {'cui': 'C0013621', 'cui_str': 'Education'}, {'cui': 'C3639708', 'cui_str': 'Clinical global impression scale'}, {'cui': 'C0032105', 'cui_str': 'blood plasma'}, {'cui': 'C0441889', 'cui_str': 'Levels'}, {'cui': 'C0107103', 'cui_str': 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor'}, {'cui': 'C2736430', 'cui_str': 'Matrix metallopeptidase 9'}, {'cui': 'C0165519', 'cui_str': 'Gelatinase B'}, {'cui': 'C0441833', 'cui_str': 'Groups'}, {'cui': 'C0079189', 'cui_str': 'Cytokine'}, {'cui': 'C0170657', 'cui_str': 'Serotonin Transporter'}, {'cui': 'C0017446', 'cui_str': 'Geographic Locations'}, {'cui': 'C0041252', 'cui_str': 'Tryptophan 5-monooxygenase'}, {'cui': 'C0041260', 'cui_str': 'Tryptophanase'}, {'cui': 'C0006104', 'cui_str': 'Brain structure'}, {'cui': 'C0027754', 'cui_str': 'Nerve growth factor'}]",58.0,0.107019,"Thus, sertraline showed no benefit for treatment of young children with ASD in language development or changes in molecular markers in this study.","[{'ForeName': 'Reem Rafik', 'Initials': 'RR', 'LastName': 'Alolaby', 'Affiliation': 'College of Health Sciences, California Northstate University, Rancho Cordova, CA, United States.'}, {'ForeName': 'Poonnada', 'Initials': 'P', 'LastName': 'Jiraanont', 'Affiliation': ""Faculty of Medicine, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand.""}, {'ForeName': 'Blythe', 'Initials': 'B', 'LastName': 'Durbin-Johnson', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Biostatistics, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, United States.'}, {'ForeName': 'Mittal', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Jasoliya', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, United States.'}, {'ForeName': 'Hiu-Tung', 'Initials': 'HT', 'LastName': 'Tang', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, United States.'}, {'ForeName': 'Randi', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Hagerman', 'Affiliation': 'MIND Institute, University of California Davis Medical Center, Davis, Davis, CA, United States.'}, {'ForeName': 'Flora', 'Initials': 'F', 'LastName': 'Tassone', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, United States.'}]",Frontiers in genetics,['10.3389/fgene.2020.00308']
241,32346387,Higher efficacy of rupatadine 20 mg and 10 mg versus placebo in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis: a pooled responder analysis.,"Background


The clinical efficacy of rupatadine in terms of responders has not been previously explored in perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR).
Methods


This pooled analysis included data from 6 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials conducted in PAR patients treated with rupatadine 10 mg or 20 mg, or placebo. Participants were aged ≥ 18 years, with diagnosis of PAR and a Total 4 Nasal Symptom Score (T4NSS) ≥ 5. We evaluated the T4NSS and Total 5 Symptom Score (T5SS) for 28 days of treatment, the responder proportion (50% and 75% response), and the time to response.
Results


Efficacy data from 1486 patients were analysed: 585 received placebo, 682 rupatadine 10 mg, and 219 rupatadine 20 mg. Compared with placebo, rupatadine promoted greater symptom improvements and higher responder proportions (50% and 75% response) for T4NSS and T5SS over 28 days. Symptom improvements and responder proportions were higher in the rupatadine 20 mg group vs the 10 mg group. The time to response was shorter in the rupatadine 20 mg group vs the 10 mg group for T4NSS (16 and 9 days for the 50% and 75% responses, respectively) and for T5SS (13 and 8 days for the 50% and 75% responses, respectively).
Conclusions

Between July 2013 and January 2016, patients with rosacea who tested positive for  Demodex folliculorum  were recruited. Patients received anti-mite therapy and were then randomly apportioned to receive either three 540 nm-IPL treatments at 4-week intervals (IPL group), or no treatment (control group). Telangiectasia was assessed by the same clinician at baseline and at follow-up intervals over 2 years, where ≥90% clearance of telangiectasia was considered to indicate effective treatment. The rates of effective treatment, improvement (≥30% clearance) and recurrence (original or neo-location) were compared in both groups. After 33 patients were lost during follow-up, the IPL and control groups were comprised of 107 and 120 patients for the final analysis, respectively. The rates of effective treatment and total efficacy in the IPL group (66.36 and 95.33%, respectively) were found to be significantly higher compared with those of the control group (0 and 30.83%, respectively). By contrast, the rates of recurrence were found to be lower in the IPL group (8.41%) compared with the control group (48.33%). Redness-to-blisters associated with IPL treatment (9.7% of analyzed patients) subsided within one week and hyperpigmentation (1.9%) within 3 months. To conclude, treatment with 540 nm-IPL improved facial telangiectasia in late-stage rosacea that remained after sequential anti-mite therapy and effectively reduced the recurrence of rosacea.

244,32346485,Assessing the effectiveness of a comprehensive menstrual health intervention program in Ugandan schools (MENISCUS): process evaluation of a pilot intervention study.,"Background


Poor menstrual health and hygiene (MHH) is a globally recognised public health challenge. A pilot study of an MHH intervention was conducted in two secondary schools in Entebbe, Uganda, over 9 months. The intervention included five components delivered by the implementing partner (WoMena Uganda) and the research team: (i) training teachers to implement government guidelines for puberty education, (ii) a drama skit to reduce stigma about menstruation, (iii) training in use of a menstrual kit (including re-usable pads), (iv) guidance on pain relief methods including provision of analgesics and (v) improvements to school water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities. The aim of the process evaluation was to examine implementation, context and possible causal pathways.
Methods


We collected information on fidelity, dose, reach, acceptability, context and mechanisms of impact using (i) quantitative survey data collected from female and male students in year 2 of secondary school (ages 13-21; 450 at the baseline and 369 at endline); (ii) qualitative data from 40 in-depth interviews with parents, teachers and female students, and four focus group discussions with students, stratified by gender; (iii) data from unannounced visits checking on WASH facilities throughout the study; and (iv) routine data collected as part of the implementation. Quantitative data were used primarily to assess fidelity, dose and reach. Qualitative data were used primarily to assess acceptability, context and possible mechanisms.
Results


Both schools received all intervention elements that were delivered by the research team and implementing partner. The drama skit, menstrual kit and pain management intervention components were delivered with fidelity. Intervention components that relied on school ownership (puberty education training and WASH improvements) were not fully delivered. Overall, the intervention was acceptable to participants. Multilevel contextual factors including schools' social and physical environment, and family, cultural and social factors influenced the acceptability of the intervention in the school setting. The intervention components reinforced one another, as suggested in our theoretical framework.
Conclusion


The intervention was feasible to deliver and acceptable to the schools and students. We propose a full-scale cluster-randomised trial to evaluate the intervention, adding a school-based MHH leadership group to address issues with school ownership.

245,32346487,Acupuncture or auricular electro-acupuncture as adjuncts to lifestyle interventions for weight management in PCOS: protocol for a randomised controlled feasibility study.,"Background


Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent women's health condition with reproductive, metabolic, and psychological manifestations. Weight loss can improve these symptoms and is a key goal; however, many women find this difficult to achieve. Acupuncture is a Chinese medical treatment that involves insertion of very fine metal needles into specific areas of the body and has been shown to be efficacious for weight loss in non-PCOS populations. However, few studies have been conducted in women with PCOS. A variant of acupuncture, auricular electro-acupuncture (AEA), may have beneficial effects on sympathetic tone, which is associated with insulin resistance, obesity and PCOS.
Methods


This prospective three-arm open label parallel randomised controlled trial will assess feasibility and acceptability of acupuncture and/or AEA for weight loss in women with PCOS. We will enrol 39 women from the community aged between 18 and 45 years, with physician diagnosis of PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria: body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 40 kg/m 2 . Women will be randomly allocated to receive one of three treatments for 12 weeks duration: body electro-acupuncture + lifestyle interventions, AEA + lifestyle interventions, or lifestyle interventions alone. The lifestyle intervention in this study is telephone-based health coaching (between 4 and 13 phone calls, depending on individual need), provided by the Get Healthy Service. Primary outcomes of the study are feasibility and acceptability of trial methods as determined by recruitment and retention rates, adherence, acceptability, credibility, and safety. Secondary outcomes include anthropometric (body weight, BMI, waist and hip circumference), metabolic (glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity obtained from a 2-h 75 g oral glucose tolerance test with area under the curve insulin calculated using the trapezoid rule), reproductive (androgen levels, menstrual cyclicity, clinical hyperandrogenism using the Ferriman-Gallwey scoring system), autonomic (heart rate variability, blood pressure), lifestyle (physical activity levels, diet quality, weight self-efficacy), quality of life, and psychological (depression and anxiety symptoms, internal health locus of control).
Discussion


This study addresses the feasibility and acceptability of novel interventions to treat overweight/obesity in PCOS. Study findings have the potential to generate a new understanding of the role of acupuncture and auricular acupuncture in weight management.

249,32367010,Exposure to direct-to-consumer advertising is associated with overestimation of benefits regarding ultrahypofractionated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND


While direct-to-consumer (DTC) medical advertising can provide useful information, it also risks oversimplification and being misleading. For an abbreviated prostate cancer treatment regimen called ""ultrahypofractionation"" (UHF), advertising has been used for CyberKnife (CK), a common delivery system for stereotactic body radiation therapy. We hypothesized that those viewing an advertisement for CK versus factual information would have inaccurate impressions of effectiveness and safety.
METHODS


400 men aged 40-80 were randomly assigned to one of four arms: a de-identified CK advertisement, the same advertisement with disclaimers, scientific information obtained from review of contemporary peer-reviewed literature, and a control. Subjects answered questions regarding risks/benefits of CK and likelihood of pursuing CK versus other treatments. Regression analysis was performed to determine factors associated with CK preference.
RESULTS


400 men were included. Compared to controls, those who viewed any of the three interventions were more likely to pursue CK over other treatments (p < 0.01), with a greater increase in the advertisement groups. Respondents who viewed scientific information were less likely to agree CK is superior regarding impotence and urinary dysfunction. Disclaimers decreased positive impressions of CK's side effects, but not effectiveness. Both advertisement and advertisement with disclaimer respondents were more likely to consider CK superior.
CONCLUSIONS


DTC medical advertisements can be misleading and impact laypersons' impressions.

250,32367114,Effects of Mu-Opiate Receptor Gene Polymorphism rs1799971 (A118G) on the Antidepressant and Dissociation Responses in Esketamine Nasal Spray Clinical Trials.,"BACKGROUND


At ketamine and esketamine doses at which antidepressant doses are achieved, these agents are relatively selective, non-competitive, NMDAR antagonists. However, at substantially higher doses, ketamine has shown mu-opioid receptor (MOR-gene symbol:OPRM1) agonist effects Preliminary clinical studies showed conflicting results on whether naltrexone, a MOR antagonist, blocks the antidepressant action of ketamine. We examined drug-induced or endogenous MOR involvement in the antidepressant and dissociative responses to esketamine by assessing the effects of a functional single nucleotide polymorphism rs1799971 (A118G) of OPRM1, which is known to alter MOR agonist-mediated responses.
METHODS


Participants with treatment-resistant depression from two phase 3, double-blind, controlled trials of esketamine or placebo nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant (AD) were genotyped for rs1799971. Participants received the experimental agents twice weekly for 4 weeks. Antidepressant responses were rated using the change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score on days 2 and 28 post-dose initiation, and dissociative side effects were assessed using the Clinician-Administered Dissociative-States Scale at 40 minutes post-dose on days 1 and 25.
RESULTS


In the esketamine+AD arm no significant genotype effect of SNP rs1799971 (A118G) on MADRS score reductions was detected on either day 2 or day 28. By contrast, in the AD+placebo arm, there was a significant genotype effect on MADRS score reductions on day 2 and a nonsignificant trend on day 28 toward an improvement in depression symptoms in G-allele carriers. No significant genotype effects on dissociative responses was detected.

251,32352082,GAPcare: The Geriatric Acute and Post-Acute Fall Prevention Intervention for Emergency Department Patients - A Qualitative Evaluation.,"Background


Three million US emergency department (ED) visits occur for falls each year. The mortality of falls is increasing and only one fourth of older adults report their fall to their primary care provider, suggesting that valuable preventative opportunities are missed. A fall prevention intervention initiated in the ED immediately after a fall has the potential to reduce subsequent falls, but ED providers lack the time and resources to complete fall risk assessments on their patients. GAPcare, the Geriatric Acute and Post-Acute Fall Prevention Intervention, was developed to address this need.
Methods


GAPcare combines a pharmacist-led medication therapy management intervention with a physical therapist (PT)-administered fall risk assessment and disposition planning. A key objective of this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to create a patient and caregiver-centric intervention. This manuscript reports on the results of the qualitative companion study in which we conducted in-depth interviews with patients and caregivers to determine their lived experience with the intervention, barriers and perceived impact of the intervention, and to obtain their recommendations for the improvement of GAPcare. We recruited patients and their caregivers from the RCT into 30 minutes interviews in the participants' home singularly or in dyads (patient and caregiver together). Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and double-coded. We used applied thematic analysis to guide the data analysis.
Results


We conducted 20 interviews; patients (n=12), caregivers (n=11). Patients were on average 83 years old, 7/12 were female, and 2/14 had cognitive impairment. 6/11 caregiver interviews were in reference to a patient with dementia. Patients and caregivers reported they embraced the experience of motivational interviewing elements, citing its collaborative and inclusive nature. Caregivers in particular said they felt that PT helped their loved one recognize and overcome functional limitations. Barriers included lack of time, the burden of coordinating multiple service providers once home, and concerns that PT would be ineffective or increase pain. Areas for improvement included better screening for those who would benefit from the individual components (pharmacy vs. PT consultation), improving identification of GAPcare pharmacists and PTs vs. other hospital staff in the ED, and expanding the role of GAPcare personnel to provide culturally competent, comprehensive care to improve adherence and medication education.
Conclusions


We found that GAPcare, a new team-based intervention for fall prevention in the ED, was welcomed by patients and their caregivers. Several suggestions to improve the intervention were made that will inform the screening, content, and communication with patients in GAPcare.",2019,"We found that GAPcare, a new team-based intervention for fall prevention in the ED, was welcomed by patients and their caregivers.","['Patients were on average 83 years old, 7/12 were female, and 2/14 had cognitive impairment', '20 interviews; patients (n=12), caregivers (n=11', ""recruited patients and their caregivers from the RCT into 30 minutes interviews in the participants' home singularly or in dyads (patient and caregiver together""]","['physical therapist (PT)-administered fall risk assessment and disposition planning', 'GAPcare']","['mortality of falls', 'pain']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0580836', 'cui_str': 'Old'}, {'cui': 'C0043210', 'cui_str': 'Woman'}, {'cui': 'C0338656', 'cui_str': 'Impaired cognition'}, {'cui': 'C0021822', 'cui_str': 'Interviews as Topic'}, {'cui': 'C0085537', 'cui_str': 'Caregiver'}, {'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}, {'cui': 'C0008976', 'cui_str': 'Clinical trial'}, {'cui': 'C0332286', 'cui_str': 'Into'}, {'cui': 'C0456693', 'cui_str': '/30 min'}, {'cui': 'C0442519', 'cui_str': 'Domestic'}, {'cui': 'C0002838', 'cui_str': 'Andorra'}]","[{'cui': 'C2362565', 'cui_str': 'Physiotherapist'}, {'cui': 'C1533734', 'cui_str': 'Administration'}, {'cui': 'C1532976', 'cui_str': 'Fall risk assessment'}, {'cui': 'C0184758', 'cui_str': 'Patient disposition'}, {'cui': 'C0032074', 'cui_str': 'Cognitive function: planning'}]","[{'cui': 'C0026565', 'cui_str': 'Mortality rate'}, {'cui': 'C0000921', 'cui_str': 'Accidental fall'}, {'cui': 'C0030193', 'cui_str': 'Pain'}]",,0.0238018,"We found that GAPcare, a new team-based intervention for fall prevention in the ED, was welcomed by patients and their caregivers.","[{'ForeName': 'Elizabeth M', 'Initials': 'EM', 'LastName': 'Goldberg', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Emergency Medicine, The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Cameron J', 'Initials': 'CJ', 'LastName': 'Gettel', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Emergency Medicine, National Clinician Scholars Program, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kelsey', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Hayes', 'Affiliation': 'College of Our Lady of the Elms, Chicopee, MA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Renee R', 'Initials': 'RR', 'LastName': 'Shield', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Health Services, Policy and Practice, Brown University School of Public Health, 121 South Main Street, Providence, RI, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kate M', 'Initials': 'KM', 'LastName': 'Guthrie', 'Affiliation': 'Centers for Behavioral and Preventive Medicine, Miriam Hospital, Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA.'}]",OBM geriatrics,['10.21926/obm.geriatr.1904078']

253,32352165,Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the prevention of dementia.,"BACKGROUND


Dementia is a worldwide concern. Its global prevalence is increasing. At present, there is no medication licensed to prevent or delay the onset of dementia. Inflammation has been suggested as a key factor in dementia pathogenesis. Therefore, medications with anti-inflammatory properties could be beneficial for dementia prevention.
OBJECTIVES


To evaluate the effectiveness and adverse effects of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the primary or secondary prevention of dementia.
SEARCH METHODS


We searched ALOIS, the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group up to 9 January 2020. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of several major healthcare databases, trial registries and grey literature sources. We ran additional searches across MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP) and six other databases to ensure that the searches were as comprehensive and up-to-date as possible. We also reviewed citations of reference lists of included studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA


We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing aspirin or other NSAIDs with placebo for the primary or secondary prevention of dementia. We included trials with cognitively healthy participants (primary prevention) or participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or cognitive complaints (secondary prevention).
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS


We used standard methodological procedures according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the strength of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.
MAIN RESULTS


We included four RCTs with 23,187 participants. Because of the diversity of these trials, we did not combine data to give summary estimates, but presented a narrative description of the evidence. We identified one trial (19,114 participants) comparing low-dose aspirin (100 mg once daily) to placebo. Participants were aged 70 years or older with no history of dementia, cardiovascular disease or physical disability. Interim analysis indicated no significant treatment effect and the trial was terminated slightly early after a median of 4.7 years' follow-up. There was no evidence of a difference in incidence of dementia between aspirin and placebo groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.15; high-certainty evidence). Participants allocated aspirin had higher rates of major bleeding (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.60, high-certainty evidence) and slightly higher mortality (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.28; high-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in activities of daily living between groups (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.02; high-certainty evidence). We identified three trials comparing non-aspirin NSAIDs to placebo. All three trials were terminated early due to adverse events associated with NSAIDs reported in other trials. One trial (2528 participants) investigated the cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib (200 mg twice daily) and the non-selective NSAID naproxen (220 mg twice daily) for preventing dementia in cognitively healthy older adults with a family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Median follow-up was 734 days. Combining both NSAID treatment arms, there was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of AD between participants allocated NSAIDs and those allocated placebo (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.89 to 4.10; moderate-certainty evidence). There was also no evidence of a difference in rates of myocardial infarction (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.40), stroke (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.76 to 4.37) or mortality (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.43) between treatment groups (all moderate-certainty evidence). One trial (88 participants) assessed the effectiveness of celecoxib (200 mg or 400 mg daily) in delaying cognitive decline in participants aged 40 to 81 years with mild age-related memory loss but normal memory performance scores. Mean duration of follow-up was 17.6 months in the celecoxib group and 18.1 months in the placebo group. There was no evidence of a difference between groups in test scores in any of six cognitive domains. Participants allocated celecoxib experienced more gastrointestinal adverse events than those allocated placebo (RR 2.66, 95% CI 1.05 to 6.75; low-certainty evidence). One trial (1457 participants) assessed the effectiveness of the COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib (25 mg once daily) in delaying or preventing a diagnosis of AD in participants with MCI. Median duration of study participation was 115 weeks in the rofecoxib group and 130 weeks in the placebo group. There was a higher incidence of AD in the rofecoxib than the placebo group (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.72; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between groups in cardiovascular adverse events (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.66; moderate-certainty evidence) or mortality (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.85 to 3.05; moderate-certainty evidence). Participants allocated rofecoxib had more upper gastrointestinal adverse events (RR 3.53, 95% CI 1.17 to 10.68; moderate-certainty evidence). Reported annual mean difference scores showed no evidence of a difference between groups in activities of daily living (year 1: no data available; year 2: 0.0, 95% CI -0.1 to 0.2; year 3: 0.1, 95% CI -0.1 to 0.3; year 4: 0.1, 95% CI -0.1 to 0.4; moderate-certainty evidence).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS


There is no evidence to support the use of low-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs of any class (celecoxib, rofecoxib or naproxen) for the prevention of dementia, but there was evidence of harm. Although there were limitations in the available evidence, it seems unlikely that there is any need for further trials of low-dose aspirin for dementia prevention. If future studies of NSAIDs for dementia prevention are planned, they will need to be cognisant of the safety concerns arising from the existing studies.",2020,"Participants allocated rofecoxib had more upper gastrointestinal adverse events (RR 3.53, 95% CI 1.17 to 10.68;

255,32352250,Loteprednol etabonate gel 0.5% vs prednisolone acetate suspension 1% for the treatment of inflammation after cataract surgery in children.,"PURPOSE


To compare loteprednol etabonate (LE) gel 0.5% with prednisolone acetate (PA) suspension 1% for the treatment of inflammation after cataract surgery in children.
SETTING


Eleven sites in the United States.
DESIGN


Randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, noninferiority study.
METHODS


Eligible patients were ≤11 years of age and candidates for routine, uncomplicated cataract surgery. Patients were randomized to a 4-week post-surgical regimen with LE gel 0.5% or PA 1%, twice on the day of surgery, 4 times daily for 2 weeks, twice daily for 1 week, and once daily for 1 week. Assessments included anterior chamber (AC) cells/flare, AC inflammation (ACI), synechiae, precipitates on the implant/cornea, visual acuity, and intraocular pressure (IOP).
RESULTS


The intent-to-treat population comprised 105 patients (LE gel, n=53; PA 1%, n=52) including 52 patients aged ≤3 years. Patients achieved a similar mean ACI grade on postoperative day 14 (primary efficacy endpoint) whether treated with LE gel 0.5% or PA 1% (difference = 0.006, 2-sided 95% CI = -0.281 to 0.292). Similar ACI outcomes were observed in patients ≤3 years of age. LE gel and PA 1% also appeared equally effective in resolving inflammation at all visits (days 7, 14, 28 post-surgery), based on categorical distributions of ACI, AC cells, and AC flare scores/grades (P≥0.06). Synechiae and corneal/implant precipitates occurred infrequently with no significant differences between groups.

Many immunosuppressive mechanisms implicated in HCC recurrence are modulated by VEGF and/or immune checkpoints such as PD-L1. Atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitor) plus bevacizumab (VEGF inhibitor) has been shown to significantly improve overall survival, progression-free survival and overall response rate in unresectable HCC. Dual PD-L1/VEGF blockade may be effective in reducing HCC recurrence by creating a more immune-favorable microenvironment. We describe the rationale and design of IMbrave 050 (NCT04102098), a randomized, open-label, Phase III study comparing atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus active surveillance in HCC patients at high-risk of recurrence following curative resection or ablation.

To evaluate the two-year effect of dentin pretreatment with epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on the clinical performance of restorations of noncarious cervical lesions (NCCLs) with Single Bond Universal, applied in two different modes (self-etch and etch-and-rinse).
METHODS AND MATERIALS


In this randomized clinical trial, 33 volunteers were selected, and 156 NCCLs were assigned to four groups: ER, etch-and-rinse; ER-EGCG, 0.1% EGCG dentin pretreatment + etch-and-rinse; SE, self-etch; and SE-EGCG, 0.1% EGCG dentin pretreatment + self-etch. The NCCLs were restored with a nanofilled resin composite and evaluated at baseline and at six, 12, 18, and 24 months using FDI criteria for retention, marginal staining, marginal adaptation, caries, and postoperative sensitivity. Two evaluators were blinded to the treatments performed, and impressions were taken for resin replicas to allow indirect observations. Statistical analyses were performed with Kruskal-Wallis and McNemar tests with a significance level of 5%.
RESULTS


Six restorations (one from ER, two from SE, one from ER-EGCG, and two from SE-EGCG) were lost at 24 months with no significant differences ( p >0.05). The retention rates were 97.0% (ER and ER-EGCG), 94.1% (SE), and 94.2% (SE-EGCG). For marginal adaptation, a significant difference was detected between the baseline and 24 months for the SE group ( p =0.0313). There were no statistical differences among all other evaluated criteria at 24 months, neither for each group at baseline nor for 24-month comparisons ( p >0.05).

260,32282587,Accelerated Approval of 17α-Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate: A Cautionary Tale.,"Before 2011, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) was used to prevent recurrent preterm birth in women with singleton pregnancies and was compounded at a low cost (∼$15 per injection). In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a commercial version of 17P (trade name ""Makena"") through their Accelerated Approval Program, and the price of 17P subsequently increased by nearly 100-fold. This approval was largely based on a methodologically limited, placebo-controlled trial, which found that although 17P significantly reduced preterm births, the placebo group had significantly more participants with a history of preterm birth, potentially confounding the results. The FDA required a confirmatory trial for continued approval that demonstrated clinical benefit. Eight years after accelerated approval, the confirmatory trial, PROLONG (Progestin's Role in Optimizing Neonatal Gestation), found no evidence of an effect of Makena for reducing recurrent preterm birth or perinatal mortality. Trial completion triggered an automatic review of Makena by an advisory committee, which voted 9-7 to recommend revoking approval of Makena for preterm birth. Although the FDA created the Accelerated Approval Program to introduce therapies for serious conditions that lacked treatment options, Makena is an example of the limitations of this program. We encourage the FDA to re-evaluate their program and consider improvements, such as shorter timeframes to complete confirmatory trials, potentially revoking approval if the studies are not completed within a predefined timeframe, and to hold manufacturers responsible, in part, for the costs of therapy if they cannot prove a clinical benefit.",2020,"Trial completion triggered an automatic review of Makena by an advisory committee, which voted 9-7 to recommend revoking approval of Makena for preterm birth.",['women with singleton pregnancies'],"['17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P', '17α-Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate', 'placebo']","['recurrent preterm birth or perinatal mortality', 'recurrent preterm birth']","[{'cui': 'C0043210', 'cui_str': 'Woman'}, {'cui': 'C0032961', 'cui_str': 'Pregnancy'}]","[{'cui': 'C0044971', 'cui_str': 'Hydroxyprogesterone caproate'}, {'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}]","[{'cui': 'C1455761', 'cui_str': 'Episodic'}, {'cui': 'C0151526', 'cui_str': 'Premature pregnancy delivered'}, {'cui': 'C0031062', 'cui_str': 'Perinatal Mortality'}]",,0.196624,"Trial completion triggered an automatic review of Makena by an advisory committee, which voted 9-7 to recommend revoking approval of Makena for preterm birth.","[{'ForeName': 'Bethany J', 'Initials': 'BJ', 'LastName': 'Godlewski', 'Affiliation': 'Center for Evidence-based Policy at Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon.'}, {'ForeName': 'Lily I', 'Initials': 'LI', 'LastName': 'Sobolik', 'Affiliation': ''}, {'ForeName': 'Valerie J', 'Initials': 'VJ', 'LastName': 'King', 'Affiliation': ''}, {'ForeName': 'Curtis S', 'Initials': 'CS', 'LastName': 'Harrod', 'Affiliation': ''}]",Obstetrics and gynecology,['10.1097/AOG.0000000000003787']

The objective of this study was to use LC-MS/MS to compare the pharmacodynamic properties and bioequivalence of two 200-mg formulations of racecadotril: suspension formulation (test) and granule formulation (reference) in healthy Chinese subjects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS


A single-dose, randomized, two-period crossover study was conducted in fasted healthy Chinese subjects, who received a single oral dose of the test or reference formulation, followed by a 7-day washout period and administration of the alternate formulation.
RESULTS


The rapid and highly sensitive LC-MS/MS method exhibited a reasonable linearity range (2.324 - 952.000 ng/mL) and high sensitivity (LLOQ of 2.324 ng/mL). The within- and between-run precision, accuracy, and stability results were within the acceptable limits, and no matrix effect was observed. The 90% CI of the ratio of geometric means for AUC 0-t , AUC 0-∞ , and C max  were 88.1 - 102.3%, 87.9 - 101.5% and 99.5 - 113%, respectively, which met the regulatory criteria for bioequivalence.

This study developed and investigated a new, comprehensive, multifactorial, daily, intensive, psychologist coaching program based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) modules. The program was delivered via the digital health care mobile services Noom Coach and InBody.
METHODS


This was an open-label, active-comparator, randomized controlled trial. A total of 70 female participants with BMI scores above 24 kg/m 2  and no clinical problems besides obesity were randomized into experimental and control groups. The experimental (ie, digital CBT) group (n=45) was connected with a therapist intervention using a digital health care service that provided daily feedback and assignments for 8 weeks. The control group (n=25) also used the digital health care service, but practiced self-care without therapist intervention. The main outcomes of this study were measured objectively at baseline, 8 weeks, and 24 weeks and included weight (kg) as well as other body compositions. Differences between groups were evaluated using independent t tests and a per-protocol framework.
RESULTS


Mean weight loss at 8 weeks in the digital CBT group was significantly higher than in the control group (-3.1%, SD 4.5, vs -0.7%, SD 3.4, P=.04). Additionally, the proportion of subjects who attained conventional 5% weight loss from baseline in the digital CBT group was significantly higher than in the control group at 8 weeks (32% [12/38] vs 4% [1/21], P=.02) but not at 24 weeks. Mean fat mass reduction in the digital CBT group at 8 weeks was also significantly greater than in the control group (-6.3%, SD 8.8, vs -0.8%, SD 8.1, P=.02). Mean leptin and insulin resistance in the digital CBT group at 8 weeks was significantly reduced compared to the control group (-15.8%, SD 29.9, vs 7.2%, SD 35.9, P=.01; and -7.1%, SD 35.1, vs 14.4%, SD 41.2, P=.04). Emotional eating behavior (ie, mean score) measured by questionnaire (ie, the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire) at 8 weeks was significantly improved compared to the control group (-2.8%, SD 34.4, vs 21.6%, SD 56.9, P=.048). Mean snack calorie intake in the digital CBT group during the intervention period was significantly lower than in the control group (135.9 kcal, SD 86.4, vs 208.2 kcal, SD 166.3, P=.02). Lastly, baseline depression, anxiety, and self-esteem levels significantly predicted long-term clinical outcomes (24 weeks), while baseline motivation significantly predicted both short-term (8 weeks) and long-term clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS


These findings confirm that technology-based interventions should be multidimensional and are most effective with human feedback and support. This study is innovative in successfully developing and verifying the effects of a new CBT approach with a multidisciplinary team based on digital technologies rather than standalone technology-based interventions.

263,32352393,Effects of Sharing Old Pictures With Grandchildren on Intergenerational Relationships: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND


Intergenerational relationships are beneficial for both grandparents and grandchildren. A positive grandparent-grandchild relationship can improve the psychological well-being of older adults and be a source of social support, family history, and identity development. Maintaining meaningful interactions can be, however, a challenging endeavor, especially as life events lead to relocating geographically. Grandparents and grandchildren can have different preferences in terms of communication mediums and different assumptions about the real conversational needs of the other.
OBJECTIVE


In this study, we will investigate the feasibility and effect of sharing memories of older adults with their grandchildren in social media. This intervention focuses on bringing snippets of the lives of the grandparents into the grandchildren's social media feed and analyzing the potential effect on relational quality, relational investment, and conversational resources from the perspective of the grandchildren.
METHODS


A randomized controlled trial will be used to measure the effectiveness of sharing family memories through social media on intergenerational relationships from the perspective of the grandchildren. The study will be implemented in Mongolia among 60 grandparent-grandchild pairs who will be assigned to either a control or intervention group. Pictures and stories will be collected during reminiscence sessions between the researchers and the grandparents before the intervention. During an intervention period of 2 months, grandchildren in the intervention group will receive pictures and stories of their grandparents on their social media account. Pre- and postintervention questionnaires will measure relationship quality, relationship investment, and conversational resources and will be used to assess the effectiveness of the intervention.
RESULTS


We conducted a pretest pilot from January to April 2018 among 6 pairs of participants (6 grandparents and 6 grandchildren). The validation of the protocol was focused on the process, instruments, and technological setup. We continued the study after the validation, and 59 pairs of participants (59 grandparents and 59 grandchildren) have been recruited. The data collection was completed in November 2019.
CONCLUSIONS


The results of this study will contribute to strategies to stimulate social interactions in intergenerational pairs. A validation of the study process is also presented to provide further operational recommendations. The lessons learned during the validation of the protocol are discussed with recommendations and implications for the recruitment, reminiscence sessions, technological setup, and administration of instruments.

264,32352398,Effect of high-dose vitamin D supplementation on antibody titers to heat shock protein 27 in adolescent girls.,"Background Although vitamin D deficiency is associated with several inflammatory conditions, there have been few studies on the effects of vitamin D supplementation on markers of oxidative stress (OS) and inflammation. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of high-dose vitamin D supplementation on heat shock protein 27 antibody (anti-Hsp27) titers in adolescent girls. Methods Five hundred and fifty adolescent girls received vitamin D3 at a dose of 50,000 IU/week for 9 weeks. Demographic, clinical and biochemical markers including serum fasting blood glucose (FBG), lipid profile and anti-Hsp27 titers as well as hematological parameters including white blood cell (WBC) count and red blood cell (RBC) distribution width (RDW) were determined in all the subjects at baseline and at the end of the study. Results Serum vitamin D significantly increased from 6.4 (4.2-9.6) ng/mL to 35.6 (25.8-47.5) ng/mL (p < 0.001) following the intervention. Furthermore, serum anti-Hsp27 titers were significantly lower after the 9-week vitamin D administration period (0.22 [0.12-0.33] optical density [OD] vs. 0.19 [0.11-0.31] OD; p = 0.002). A significant correlation was found between serum anti-Hsp27 and RDW (r = 0.13, p = 0.037). The reduction in RDW values after intervention was particularly evident in subjects with the greatest increase in serum vitamin D levels.

265,32352493,Safety and Vision Outcomes of Subretinal Gene Therapy Targeting Cone Photoreceptors in Achromatopsia: A Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.,"Importance


Achromatopsia linked to variations in the CNGA3 gene is associated with day blindness, poor visual acuity, photophobia, and involuntary eye movements owing to lack of cone photoreceptor function. No treatment is currently available.
Objective


To assess safety and vision outcomes of supplemental gene therapy with adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding CNGA3 (AAV8.CNGA3) in patients with CNGA3-linked achromatopsia.
Design, Setting, and Participants


This open-label, exploratory nonrandomized controlled trial tested safety and vision outcomes of gene therapy vector AAV8.CNGA3 administered by subretinal injection at a single center. Nine patients (3 per dose group) with a clinical diagnosis of achromatopsia and confirmed biallelic disease-linked variants in CNGA3 were enrolled between November 5, 2015, and September 22, 2016. Data analysis was performed from June 6, 2017, to March 12, 2018.
Intervention


Patients received a single unilateral injection of 1.0 × 1010, 5.0 × 1010, or 1.0 × 1011 total vector genomes of AAV8.CNGA3 and were followed up for a period of 12 months (November 11, 2015, to October 10, 2017).
Main Outcomes and Measures


Safety as the primary end point was assessed by clinical examination of ocular inflammation. Systemic safety was assessed by vital signs, routine clinical chemistry testing, and full and differential blood cell counts. Secondary outcomes were change in visual function from baseline in terms of spatial and temporal resolution and chromatic, luminance, and contrast sensitivity throughout a period of 12 months after treatment.
Results


Nine patients (mean [SD] age, 39.6 [11.9] years; age range, 24-59 years; 8 [89%] male) were included in the study. Baseline visual acuity letter score (approximate Snellen equivalent) ranged from 34 (20/200) to 49 (20/100), whereas baseline contrast sensitivity log scores ranged from 0.1 to 0.9. All 9 patients underwent surgery and subretinal injection of AAV8.CNGA3 without complications. No substantial safety problems were observed during the 12-month follow-up period. Despite the congenital deprivation of cone photoreceptor-mediated vision in achromatopsia, all 9 treated eyes demonstrated some level of improvement in secondary end points regarding cone function, including mean change in visual acuity of 2.9 letters (95% CI, 1.65-4.13; P = .006, 2-sided t test paired samples). Contrast sensitivity improved by a mean of 0.33 log (95% CI, 0.14-0.51 log; P = .003, 2-sided t test paired samples).
Conclusions and Relevance


Subretinal gene therapy with AAV8.CNGA3 was not associated with substantial safety problems and was associated with cone photoreceptor activation in adult patients, as reflected by visual acuity and contrast sensitivity gains.

266,32352505,Efficacy of Nivolumab and AVD in Early-Stage Unfavorable Classic Hodgkin Lymphoma: The Randomized Phase 2 German Hodgkin Study Group NIVAHL Trial.,"Importance


In early-stage unfavorable classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), conventional therapy induces high cure rates but also relevant acute and long-term toxic effects. Nivolumab is well tolerated and highly effective in relapsed/refractory cHL but has not been adequately studied in first-line treatment of early-stage cHL. The NIVAHL trial evaluated nivolumab in this setting with the aim to develop a highly effective yet tolerable systemic therapy to ultimately mitigate morbidity in patients who survive cHL.
Objective


To evaluate efficacy of 2 experimental nivolumab-based first-line treatment strategies in patients with early-stage unfavorable cHL.
Design, Setting, and Participants


This was an open-label, multicenter, phase 2 randomized clinical trial, open between April 2017 and October 2018. The trial took place at 35 trial centers across Germany, ranging from academic centers to private offices. Eligibility was defined by age 18 to 60 years, cHL confirmed by expert pathology review, early-stage unfavorable disease by German Hodgkin Study Group criteria (stage I to II with risk factor[s]), and absence of serious concomitant disease or organ dysfunction. Among 110 enrolled patients, 109 were eligible.
Interventions


Systemic therapy, per random assignment (1:1) to either concomitant treatment with 4 cycles of nivolumab and doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (N-AVD) or sequential treatment with 4 doses of nivolumab, 2 cycles of N-AVD, and 2 cycles of AVD at standard doses, followed by 30-Gy involved-site radiotherapy.
Main Outcomes and Measures


Complete remission (CR) rate after study treatment, aiming at excluding a CR rate of 80% or lower via a 2-sided 95% CI for each treatment group.
Results


Of 109 patients included in this study, 65 (59.6%) were women, and the median (range) age was 27 (18-60) years. At interim staging after 2 cycles of N-AVD or 4 doses of nivolumab monotherapy, 54 of 54 (100%) and 49 of 51 (96%) response-eligible patients, respectively, achieved an objective response, with CR in 47 (87%) and 26 (51%) patients, respectively. Among 101 patients eligible for primary end point analysis, 46 of 51 (90%; 95% CI, 79%-97%) patients receiving concomitant therapy and 47 of 50 (94%; 95% CI, 84%-99%) patients receiving sequential therapy achieved CR after study treatment. With a median follow-up of 13 months, 12-month progression-free survival was 100% for patients receiving concomitant treatment and 98% (95% CI, 95%-100%) for patients receiving sequential therapy.
Conclusions and Relevance


Both strategies combining nivolumab and AVD are feasible and resulted in high remission rates. Despite narrowly missing the efficacy benchmark in the concomitant group, the excellent 12-month progression-free survival and the unexpectedly high CR rate after 4 doses of nivolumab monotherapy warrant further evaluation of this approach in the first-line treatment of patients with early-stage cHL.

267,32352530,Association of Patient Demographic Characteristics and Insurance Status With Survival in Cancer Randomized Clinical Trials With Positive Findings.,"Importance


Few new treatments tested in phase 3 cancer randomized clinical trials show an overall survival benefit. Although understanding whether the benefits are consistent among all patient groups is critical for informing guideline care, individual trials are designed to assess the benefits of experimental treatments among all patients and are too small to reliably determine whether treatment benefits apply to demographic or insurance subgroups.
Objective


To systematically examine whether positive treatment effects in cancer randomized clinical trials apply to specific demographic or insurance subgroups.
Design, Setting, and Participants


Cohort study of pooled patient-level data from 10 804 patients in SWOG Cancer Research Network clinical treatment trials reported from 1985 onward with superior overall survival for those receiving experimental treatment. Patients were enrolled from 1984 to 2012. Maximum follow-up was 5 years.
Main Outcomes and Measures


Interaction tests were used to assess whether hazard ratios (HRs) for death comparing standard group vs experimental group treatments were associated with age (≥65 vs <65 years), race/ethnicity (minority vs nonminority populations), sex, or insurance status among patients younger than 65 years (Medicaid or no insurance vs private insurance) in multivariable Cox regression frailty models. Progression- or relapse-free survival was also examined. Data analyses were conducted from August 2019 to February 2020.
Results


In total, 19 trials including 10 804 patients were identified that reported superior overall survival for patients randomized to experimental treatment. Patients were predominantly younger than 65 years (67.3%) and female (66.3%); 11.4% were black patients, and 5.7% were Hispanic patients. There was evidence of added survival benefits associated with receipt of experimental therapy for all groups except for patients with Medicaid or no insurance (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.97-1.56; P = .09) compared with those with private insurance (HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.44-1.92; P < .001; P = .03 for interaction). Receipt of experimental treatment was associated with reduced added overall survival benefits in patients 65 years or older (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.11-1.32; P < .001) compared with patients younger than 65 years (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.30-1.53; P < .001; P = .01 for interaction), although both older and younger patients appeared to strongly benefit from receipt of experimental treatment. The progression- or relapse-free survival HRs did not differ by age, sex, or race/ethnicity but differed between patients with Medicaid or no insurance (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.06-1.64; P = .01) vs private insurance (HR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.54-1.97; P < .001; P = .03 for interaction).
Conclusions and Relevance


Patients with Medicaid or no insurance may have smaller added benefits from experimental therapies compared with standard treatments in clinical trials. A better understanding of the quality of survivorship care that patients with suboptimal insurance receive, including supportive care and posttreatment care, could help establish how external factors may affect outcomes for these patients.",2020,"P = .01 for interaction), although both older and younger patients appeared to strongly benefit from receipt of experimental treatment.","['Patients were enrolled from 1984 to 2012', 'patients younger than 65 years (Medicaid or no insurance vs private insurance) in multivariable Cox regression frailty models', 'Data analyses were conducted from August 2019 to February 2020', 'Patients were predominantly younger than 65 years (67.3%) and female (66.3%); 11.4% were black patients, and 5.7% were Hispanic patients', 'patients with suboptimal insurance', 'Participants\n\n\nCohort study of pooled patient-level data from 10\u202f804 patients in SWOG Cancer Research Network clinical treatment trials reported from 1985 onward with superior overall survival for those receiving experimental treatment']",[],"['overall survival benefits', 'overall survival benefit', 'Patient Demographic Characteristics and Insurance Status', 'Progression- or relapse-free survival', 'added survival benefits', 'superior overall survival', 'progression- or relapse-free survival HRs', 'hazard ratios (HRs) for death']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0332239', 'cui_str': 'Young'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0025071', 'cui_str': 'Medicaid coverage'}, {'cui': 'C0021672', 'cui_str': 'Insurance'}, {'cui': 'C0033175', 'cui_str': 'Private Room'}, {'cui': 'C0033551', 'cui_str': 'Prostaglandin synthase'}, {'cui': 'C0684321', 'cui_str': 'Regression - mental defense mechanism'}, {'cui': 'C0424594', 'cui_str': 'Frailty'}, {'cui': 'C0026339', 'cui_str': 'Biological Models'}, {'cui': 'C0002778', 'cui_str': 'Analysis'}, {'cui': 'C0004927', 'cui_str': 'Behavior finding'}, {'cui': 'C0043210', 'cui_str': 'Woman'}, {'cui': 'C4517533', 'cui_str': '11.4'}, {'cui': 'C0005680', 'cui_str': 'Black - ethnic group'}, {'cui': 'C4517795', 'cui_str': '5.7'}, {'cui': 'C0086409', 'cui_str': 'Hispanic'}, {'cui': 'C0009247', 'cui_str': 'Concurrent Studies'}, {'cui': 'C0337051', 'cui_str': 'Pool'}, {'cui': 'C0441889', 'cui_str': 'Levels'}, {'cui': 'C0006826', 'cui_str': 'Malignant neoplastic disease'}, {'cui': 'C0242481', 'cui_str': 'Research Activities'}, {'cui': 'C0150775', 'cui_str': 'Social Networks'}, {'cui': 'C0205210', 'cui_str': 'Clinical'}, {'cui': 'C0039798', 'cui_str': 'therapy'}, {'cui': 'C0008976', 'cui_str': 'Clinical trial'}, {'cui': 'C0684224', 'cui_str': 'Report'}, {'cui': 'C1282910', 'cui_str': 'Upper'}, {'cui': 'C0282416', 'cui_str': 'Overall'}, {'cui': 'C0038952', 'cui_str': 'Survival'}]",[],"[{'cui': 'C0282416', 'cui_str': 'Overall'}, {'cui': 'C0038952', 'cui_str': 'Survival'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0011298', 'cui_str': 'Demographics'}, {'cui': 'C0376629', 'cui_str': 'Insurance Status'}, {'cui': 'C0242656', 'cui_str': 'Course of illness'}, {'cui': 'C0035020', 'cui_str': 'Relapse phase'}, {'cui': 'C0332296', 'cui_str': 'Free of'}, {'cui': 'C0004269', 'cui_str': 'Child attention deficit disorder'}, {'cui': 'C1282910', 'cui_str': 'Upper'}, {'cui': 'C0456603', 'cui_str': 'Ratio'}, {'cui': 'C0011065', 'cui_str': 'Death'}]",10804.0,0.224841,"P = .01 for interaction), although both older and younger patients appeared to strongly benefit from receipt of experimental treatment.","[{'ForeName': 'Joseph M', 'Initials': 'JM', 'LastName': 'Unger', 'Affiliation': 'SWOG Cancer Research Network Statistics and Data Management Center, Seattle, Washington.'}, {'ForeName': 'Charles D', 'Initials': 'CD', 'LastName': 'Blanke', 'Affiliation': ""SWOG Cancer Research Network Group Chair's Office, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland.""}, {'ForeName': 'Michael', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'LeBlanc', 'Affiliation': 'SWOG Cancer Research Network Statistics and Data Management Center, Seattle, Washington.'}, {'ForeName': 'William E', 'Initials': 'WE', 'LastName': 'Barlow', 'Affiliation': 'SWOG Cancer Research Network Statistics and Data Management Center, Seattle, Washington.'}, {'ForeName': 'Riha', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Vaidya', 'Affiliation': 'SWOG Cancer Research Network Statistics and Data Management Center, Seattle, Washington.'}, {'ForeName': 'Scott D', 'Initials': 'SD', 'LastName': 'Ramsey', 'Affiliation': 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.'}, {'ForeName': 'Dawn L', 'Initials': 'DL', 'LastName': 'Hershman', 'Affiliation': 'Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.'}]",JAMA network open,['10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.3842']
268,32352617,Psychological characteristics of Chinese patients with genuine halitosis.,"OBJECTIVE


The present case-control study aims to compare the psychological status of patients with and without halitosis, and investigate the association of psychological disorders and halitosis.
METHODS


Patients who complained about bad breath and diagnosed with genuine halitosis were assigned to the halitosis group, while patients without genuine halitosis were assigned into the control group (n=106, each group). Information on the demographics and Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) of participants were collected. The organoleptic score and Halimeter measurement were used to measure halitosis.
RESULTS


The mean SCL-90 score of participants in the halitosis group (0.63) was significantly greater than that in the control group (0.48) (P=0.002). The scores of the domains of interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, depression and paranoid ideation were found to be significantly different between two groups (P<0.05). However, there were no significant differences in SCL-90 scores between the mild and moderate-severe halitosis groups (P=0.479).
CONCLUSION

This case-control study was nested in the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial (CSPPT), a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial conducted in 32 communities in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces in China. The current study included 617 cases of all-cause mortality and 617 controls matched on age (≤1 year), sex, treatment group, and study site. All-cause mortality was the main outcome in this analysis, which included death due to any reason. The median follow-up duration was 4.5 years.

270,32352644,Effects of Dapagliflozin on Epicardial Fat Thickness in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Obesity.,"OBJECTIVE


Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) thickness is a marker of visceral fat and an emerging therapeutic target. Dapagliflozin, a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, improves glucose control and induces moderate weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Dapagliflozin has recently been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk. Nevertheless, whether dapagliflozin could reduce EAT thickness is unknown.
METHODS


This hypothesis was tested in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 100 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2  and a hemoglobin A1c level ≤ 8% on metformin monotherapy. Individuals were randomly assigned to 2 groups to receive additional dapagliflozin up to 10 mg once daily or to remain on metformin up to 1,000 mg twice daily. Ultrasound-measured EAT thickness was measured at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks.
RESULTS


In the dapagliflozin group, EAT decreased by 20% from baseline to 24 weeks, by 15% after 12 weeks, and by 7% between 12 and 24 weeks, respectively (P < 0.01 for all), whereas in the metformin group, there was a significant but smaller EAT reduction. There was no statistically significant correlation between EAT and body weight changes.
CONCLUSIONS

To compare laparoscopic manual esophagoenterostomy and esophagoenterostomy with mechanical stapling anastomotic devices after laparoscopic gastrectomy for stomach cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS


There were 34 patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy for stomach in 2015-2018. Roux-en-Y esophagoenterostomy was used to reconstruct the gastrointestinal tract. Manual anastomoses were performed in 18 patients (group 1), stapled anastomoses (endogia 45 mm, covidien, mansfield, ma, usa) - in 16 patients (group 2). There was no randomization. Surgery duration, length of icu-stay, terms of enteral nutrition initiation, postoperative complications, hospital-stay were analyzed.
RESULTS


Mean duration of surgery in the first group was 217 (184-302) min, in the second group - 201 (162-311) min. Duration of surgery in the first group was 1.08-fold higher than in the second group (95% CI 1.03-1.13,  p =0.05). Mean blood loss was 145 ml in both groups. Mean icu-stay was 20.2 (17-42) hours in the first group and 21.1 (16.2-46) hours in the second group (ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-1.01,  p =0.06). Total enteral feeding (sipping) was initiated on the third day in both groups. Mean postoperative hospital-stay was 9.21 (6-13) days in the first group and 9.23 (6-12 days) days in the second group (ratio 0.99, 95% CI 0,95-1.02,  p =0.06). Postoperative morbidity was 5.5% in the first group and 6.25% in the second group.

272,32352666,[Multi- and single-port laparoscopic surgery in the treatment of hydatid liver disease].,"OBJECTIVE


To compare the effectiveness of multi-port and single-port laparoscopic surgery in the treatment of hydatid cyst of the liver.
MATERIAL AND METHODS


There were 25 children with solitary hydatid cyst of the liver (CL-CE2) who underwent surgery in 2013-2017. Mean age was 10.1±2.05 years. There were 17 boys and 8 girls. Patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (multi-port laparoscopy) - 19 patients, group 2 (single-port laparoscopic surgery) - 6 patients.
RESULTS


Duration of ultrasound-assisted laparoscopy (G11 generator) was significantly shorter in the group 1 compared with group 2 (62.2±5.4 vs. 85.3±9.7 min,  p <0.05). Intraoperative complications were absent. Biliary fistula in postoperative period was observed in 1 (5.3%) patient of the group 1. External drainage was effective. Residual cavity in 6 months after laparoscopic resection was observed in 1 (16.7%) patient of the group 2. Recurrent liver echinococcosis was not recorded.

Is to evaluate the advantage of Contractubex gel with regards to influence on vascularisation, pigmentation, thickness, surface size, configuration, and elisticity of postsurgical scars of children (after cheilorinoplasty) in comparison to absence of systematized topical treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS


Into the prospective, non-interventional, observational, multi-centered, in parallel groups, open, controlled study were included 60 patients aged 2,5 months and older with postsurgical scars after first cheilorinoplasty after 7-14 day after operation. Patients were randomized into 2 groups of 30 patients in each. I group - patients get applications of Contractubex gel 3 times a day (in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening) in accordance with patient information leaflet. II group - control group with no regular therapy of of postsurgical scars (without treatment or without application of oils and gels with anticsarring action). The period of medicine usage - 9 months and more for each patient, the each patient observation duration is 18 months.
RESULTS


After analysis of the primary as well as secondary efficacy criteria (total grade based on POSAS scale, reported by investigator/parent) after 3, 6, 12, 18 months of observation in both groups a positive statistically significant dynamics was registered. At the same time in the Contractubex group results were statistically significantly better than in the control group. Positive dynamics was achieved quickier in the main group than in the contol group and was to observe already after 3 months of therapy, during the whole treatment and observation phase, and after 18 months of therapy. Additionally conducted photodocumentation of postsurgical scar development dynamics in terms of the study confirms positive effect of surgery and absence of visual data regarding keloids or hyperthrophic scars formation in patients in both groups. Adverse events, i. a. pain, itch, burning, long-run hyperemia were not registered during the whole period os study.
CONCLUSION


The conducted study has shown high efficacy and safety of Contractubex usage for the treatment of postsurgical scars of children with with congenital cleft lip and palate (from 2,5 months old). The statistically significant advantage of the therapy with Contractubex was demonstrated in comparison with the control group (with no regular topical treatment).

274,32348081,Comparison of efficacy & safety of 30% hydrogen peroxide with 50% trichloroacetic acid in eborrheic keratosis: a randomized controlled study.,"BACKGROUND


Seborrheic keratosis is a benign skin tumour. None of the common therapies is satisfactory. This study compared the efficacy of 30% hydrogen peroxide versus 50% trichloroacetic acid in treatment of seborrheic keratoses.
METHODS


This unblinded, comparative interventional study was conducted on 85 patients of seborrheic keratosis. Lesions were graded using physician's lesion assessment (PLA) scale (0, clear; 1, nearly clear; 2 ≤1mm thick; 3 ≥1mm thick). Patients were randomly assigned into two groups: A and B. Five target seborrheic keratosis lesions with PLA score of three were selected in each patient. Group A was treated with 30% hydrogen peroxide and group B with 50% trichloroacetic acid. Both groups received treatment every week up to 5 weeks or till complete resolution of lesions. Clinical photographs of all patients were taken every 2 weeks.
RESULTS


Both the groups were comparable in terms of age and sex. At the end of 6 weeks, lesions were cleared completely in 41.8% of patients in group A and in 23.8% in group B. Mean PLA score decreased significantly in group A from 3 to 1.79 (40.3%) at 2 weeks and to 0.63 (79%) at 6 weeks (p <0.001). The decrease in PLA score in group B was 2.41 (19.7%) and 1.13 (62.3%) at 2, and 6 weeks respectively (p<0.001). Hydrogen peroxide produced greater clearance of seborrheic keratosis (p=0.017) than trichloroacetic acid. Also, no major adverse effects were observed in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS


Application of 30% hydrogen peroxide appears to be more efficacious as compared to trichloroacetic acid (50%) for treatment of seborrheic keratosis.",2020,Hydrogen peroxide produced greater clearance of seborrheic keratosis (p=0.017) than trichloroacetic acid.,"['85 patients of seborrheic keratosis', 'eborrheic keratosis']","['30% hydrogen peroxide with 50% trichloroacetic acid', 'hydrogen peroxide', '30% hydrogen peroxide versus 50% trichloroacetic acid', 'Hydrogen peroxide', '30% hydrogen peroxide and group B with 50% trichloroacetic acid', 'trichloroacetic acid']","['PLA score', 'clearance of seborrheic keratosis', 'Mean PLA score', 'major adverse effects', 'efficacy & safety']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0022603', 'cui_str': 'Seborrheic keratosis'}, {'cui': 'C0022593', 'cui_str': 'Keratosis'}]","[{'cui': 'C0020281', 'cui_str': 'Hydrogen Peroxide'}, {'cui': 'C0040900', 'cui_str': 'Trichloroacetic acid'}, {'cui': 'C0348801', 'cui_str': 'Group B streptococcal pneumonia'}]","[{'cui': 'C0031831', 'cui_str': 'Physician'}, {'cui': 'C0221198', 'cui_str': 'Lesion'}, {'cui': 'C4758616', 'cui_str': 'Assessment score'}, {'cui': 'C0449297', 'cui_str': 'Clearance'}, {'cui': 'C0022603', 'cui_str': 'Seborrheic keratosis'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0205082', 'cui_str': 'Severe'}, {'cui': 'C0001688', 'cui_str': 'adverse effects'}, {'cui': 'C1280519', 'cui_str': 'Effectiveness'}, {'cui': 'C0036043', 'cui_str': 'Safety'}]",85.0,0.0258745,Hydrogen peroxide produced greater clearance of seborrheic keratosis (p=0.017) than trichloroacetic acid.,"[{'ForeName': 'Divya', 'Initials': 'D', 'LastName': 'Agrawal', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India.'}, {'ForeName': 'Mohammad', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Adil', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India - dr.mohd.adil@gmail.com.'}, {'ForeName': 'Syed S', 'Initials': 'SS', 'LastName': 'Amin', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India.'}, {'ForeName': 'Mohd', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Mohtashim', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India.'}, {'ForeName': 'Roopal', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Bansal', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India.'}, {'ForeName': 'Hera', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Tabassum', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India.'}]","Giornale italiano di dermatologia e venereologia : organo ufficiale, Societa italiana di dermatologia e sifilografia",['10.23736/S0392-0488.20.06518-9']

Translingual neurostimulation (TLNS) studies indicate improved outcomes in neurodegenerative disease or spinal cord injury patients. This study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of TLNS plus targeted physical therapy (PT) in people with a chronic balance deficit after mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury (mmTBI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS


This international, multicenter, randomized study enrolled 122 participants with a chronic balance deficit who had undergone PT following an mmTBI and had plateaued in recovery. Randomized participants received PT plus either high-frequency pulse (HFP; n = 59) or low-frequency pulse (LFP; n = 63) TLNS. The primary efficacy and safety endpoints were the proportion of sensory organization test (SOT) responders (SOT composite score improvement of ≥15 points) and fall frequency after five weeks of treatment, respectively.
RESULTS


The proportion of SOT responders was significant in the HFP + PT (71.2%) and LFP + PT (63.5%) groups compared with baseline (p < 0.0005). For the pooled population, the SOT responder rate was 67.2% (p < 0.00005), and there were clinically and statistically significant improvements in SOT composite scores after two and five weeks (p < 0.0005). Both groups had reductions in falls and headache disability index scores. Mean dynamic gait index scores in both groups also significantly increased from baseline at weeks 2 and 5.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)-related irritability complicates the management of autistic patients at home and clinical settings. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of adjuvant treatment with risperidone and sulforaphane in alleviating irritability of ASD patients.
METHODS


Sixty drug-free patients, aged 4-12 years, were randomly assigned to two groups receiving risperidone plus sulforaphane or placebo. Risperidone was started with a daily dose of 0.5 mg [>20 kg] and 0.25 mg in others and increased stepwise to reach a maximum of 1 mg [<20 kg], 2.5 mg [20 to <45kg], and 3.5 mg [>45kg]. Sulforaphane was administered with a daily dose of 50 μmol [<45kg] and 100 μmol [>45kg]. The participants were assessed with the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (ABC-C) at baseline, weeks five and ten.
RESULTS


Compared to the placebo group, ASD patients in the sulforaphane group showed greater improvements in irritability (primary outcome measure) (p = 0.001), hyperactivity/noncompliance (secondary outcome measure) (p = 0.015), and significant time × treatment effect for irritability (p = 0.007) and hyperactivity/noncompliance (p = 0.008). However, no difference was seen in improvements in the other secondary measures: lethargy/social interaction, stereotypic behavior, inappropriate speech, and frequency of adverse events.
CONCLUSION


Our results support the safety and efficacy of sulforaphane as an adjuvant to risperidone for improvement of irritability and hyperactivity symptoms in ASD children.

277,32347687,Visual function and subjective perception of vision following bilateral implantation of monofocal and multifocal intraocular lenses: randomized controlled trial.,"PURPOSE


To examine monocular and binocular visual function and patient reporting outcomes following implantation of multifocal intraocular lenses (mIOLs) or monofocal intraocular lenses (IOLs), using a rigorous series of clinical assessments.
SETTING


BMI Southend Hospital, United Kingdom.
DESIGN


Prospective, randomized, double-masked clinical trial.
METHODS


One hundred patients were randomized for bilateral implantation of either a Bi-Flex 677MY mIOL or a Bi-Flex 677AB IOL and were assessed at 3 to 6 months (V1) and 12 to 18 months (V2). Primary outcomes included distance, intermediate and near logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuities (VA) and defocus curve profile assessment. Secondary outcomes included reading speed, contrast sensitivity (CS), and the subjective perception of quality of vision.
RESULTS


Uncorrected (mIOL, 0.10±0.09 logMAR; IOL, 0.09±0.11 logMAR) and corrected distance VA (mIOL, 0.04±0.06 logMAR; IOL, 0.01±0.07 logMAR) were comparable (p>0.05). Uncorrected near VA (p<0.001: mIOL 0.23±0.13 logMAR; IOL, 0.55±0.20 logMAR) and distance-corrected near VA (p<0.001: mIOL, 0.24±0.13 logMAR; IOL, 0.54±0.17 logMAR) were significantly improved with mIOLs. There was no significant difference in distance-corrected intermediate VA (p=0.431: mIOL, 0.38±0.13; IOL, 0.39±0.13).Defocus curves demonstrated an increased range-of-focus among mIOLs (mIOL, 4.14±1.10D; IOL, 2.57±0.77 diopter). Pelli-Robson CS was different at V1 (p<0.001) but similar by V2 (p=0.059). Overall satisfaction was high (>90%) in both groups for distance tasks whereas significantly different for near tasks (mIOL, 18.45±16.53 logUnits; IOL, 55.59±22.52 logUnits).

278,32347688,COMPARISON OF CLINICAL OUTCOMES OF THREE TRIFOCAL INTRAOCULAR LENSES.,"PURPOSE


To compare the clinical outcomes obtained after implantation of 1 of 3 models of trifocal diffractive intraocular lenses (IOLs).
SETTING


Hospital da Luz, Lisbon, Portugal.
DESIGN


Prospective randomized comparative study.
METHODS


Ninety eyes of 45 patients undergoing cataract surgery with bilateral implantation of 1 of 3 models of trifocal diffractive IOLs were enrolled. The IOL models implanted were the FineVision POD F, RayOne Trifocal, or the Acrysof IQ PanOptix (30 eyes of 15 patients in each group). Visual acuity (VA), refraction, defocus curve, and contrast sensitivity outcomes were evaluated during a 3-month follow-up. Furthermore, the quality-of-vision (QoV) questionnaire (McAlinden et al.) was used to evaluate the frequency, severity, and discomfort of different visual symptoms.
RESULTS


No statistically significant differences were found between groups in distance, intermediate, and near VA (p≥0.112) and postoperative refraction (p≥0.059). Postoperative binocular uncorrected intermediate VA of 0.10 logMAR or better was found in 14 (93.33%) patients in the 3 groups. Postoperative binocular uncorrected near VA of 0.10 logMAR or better was found in 13 (86.67%), 14 (93.33%) and 13 (86.67%) patients in the PODF, RayOne, and PanOptix groups, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found between groups in scotopic contrast sensitivity with and without glare as well as in the QoV scores (p≥0.057), except for the difference between the PODF and RayOne groups in depth perception severity, which was less in the RayOne group (p=0.019).

279,32347692,COMPARISON OF VISUAL AND REFRACTIVE OUTCOMES OF TWO TRIFOCAL INTRAOCULAR LENSES.,"PURPOSE


To compare clinical outcomes after cataract surgery and bilateral implantation of two diffractive trifocal toric intraocular lenses (IOLs).
SETTING


Hospital da Luz, Lisbon, Portugal DESIGN:: Double arm, randomized and prospective case series METHODS:: A total of 60 patients were randomly allocated to receive bilateral implantation of either FineVision toric PODFT (PhysIOL) or Acrysof IQ PanOptix toric (Alcon) IOLs. Visual and refractive outcomes, contrast sensitivity, IOL misalignment, and quality of vision outcomes (QoV questionnaire) were evaluated at 3 months postoperatively. Surgically induced astigmatic changes were evaluated by vector analysis.
RESULTS


Each group comprised 30 patients (60 eyes). No significant differences between groups were found regarding uncorrected and corrected distance and near visual outcomes (p≥0.333). Mean postoperative distance-corrected intermediate visual acuity at 60 cm was 0.04 ± 0.09 and 0.09 ± 0.11 logMAR in the PanOptix and PODFT group, respectively (p=0.032). Mean IOL axis misalignment was 1.59 ± 2.15° (PanOptix group) and 1.89 ± 3.31° (PODFT group) (p=0.821). Mean magnitude of error of astigmatic correction was -0.09 and -0.11 D in the PanOptix and PODFT group, respectively (p=0.333). Contrast sensitivity, QoV scores for the presence of photic phenomena, and the level of spectacle independence were similar in both groups (p>0.05).

To compare clinical outcomes of small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) between manifest refraction and Vector Planning for myopic astigmatism with high ocular residual astigmatism (ORA).
SETTING


Yonsei University College of Medicine and Eyereum Eye Clinic, Seoul, Korea DESIGN:: Prospective, randomized, comparative case series METHODS:: We included 114 eyes of 114 patients with myopic astigmatism and ORA ≥ 0.75 diopters (D); patients underwent SMILE and were randomized into the manifest refraction planning (58 eyes) or vector planning group (56 eyes). Visual acuity, manifest refraction, corneal topography, and corneal aberration were measured pre- and post-operatively. Outcomes at 6 months postoperatively were compared between the groups.
RESULTS


The mean uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity, safety and efficacy indices, and aberrometric values were comparable between the two groups at 6 months after SMILE. Postoperative refractive cylinder differed significantly between the groups (-0.22 ± 0.18 D, and -0.14 ± 0.16 D in manifest refraction and vector planning groups, respectively; P = 0.02). Postoperative corneal toricity (1.07 ± 0.40 D vs 0.84 ± 0.39 D; P = 0.003) and ORA (0.98 ± 0.31 D vs 0.85 ± 0.32 D; P = 0.037) differed significantly between the groups, with favorable results for the vector planning method.
CONCLUSIONS

281,32347699,Evaluation of total corneal power measurements with a new optical biometer.,"PURPOSE


Evaluate the repeatability and validity of total corneal power measurements (TK) obtained with a recently introduced optical biometer (IOL Master 700, Zeiss, Germany) to a Scheimpflug device (Pentacam, Oculus, Germany).
SETTING


Department of Ophthalmology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany DESIGN:: Prospective randomized controlled trial METHODS:: Ninety-three eyes of 93 subjects were included. The inclusion criteria were a corneal astigmatism of 3.00 dioptres or less, no prior ocular surgery, no known corneal irregularities and no known dry eyes. All eyes were measured 3 times using the optical biometer and the Scheimpflug device. The results were statistically compared using Bland-Altman, within-subject standard deviation and astigmatism vector analysis.
RESULTS


The repeatability was 0.42 for standard K, 0.40 for TK, 0.45 for TCRP, 0.43 for TNP and 0.39 for SimK. Bland-Altman analysis showed no significant difference between the IOL Master 700´s TK compared to standard K and Pentacam´s SimK, TNP and TCRP, the P value exceeding 0.05 in each case. A difference of >0.5 D between astigmatism measurements between TK and TCRP was found in 10 cases, compared to standard K and TNP with 0 and 2 cases.
CONCLUSIONS


Repeatability of both devices was high, although measurements of meridian show a great variability, suggesting numerous measurements are needed to enhance accuracy. Total corneal refractive power measurements between recently introduced TK and TCRP cannot be used interchangeably. Future studies are necessary to evaluate which measurement will result in a better outcome when respective measurements are used for toric IOL calculations.",2020,"A difference of >0.5 D between astigmatism measurements between TK and TCRP was found in 10 cases, compared to standard K and TNP with 0 and 2 cases.

286,32347799,The Effect of Shame on Patients With Social Anxiety Disorder in Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Comparison Clinical Trial in China.,"BACKGROUND


Prior research has demonstrated the efficacy of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD). However, it is unclear how shame influences this treatment effect.
OBJECTIVE


This study aimed to investigate the role shame played in the ICBT treatment process for participants with SAD.
METHODS


A total of 104 Chinese participants (73 females; age: mean 24.92 years, SD 4.59) were divided into self-help ICBT, guided ICBT, or wait list control groups. Participants were assessed before and immediately after the intervention using Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS), Social Phobia Scale (SPS), and Experience of Shame Scale (ESS).
RESULTS


Participants' social anxiety symptoms (self-help: differences between pre and post-treatment SIAS=-12.71; Cohen d=1.01; 95% CI 9.08 to 16.32; P<.001 and differences between pre and post-treatment SPS=11.13; Cohen d=0.89; 95% CI 6.98 to 15.28; P<.001 and guided: SIAS=19.45; Cohen d=1.20; 95% CI 14.67 to 24.24; P<.001 and SPS=13.45; Cohen d=0.96; 95% CI 8.26 to 18.64; P<.001) and shame proneness (self-help: differences between pre and post-treatment ESS=7.34; Cohen d=0.75; 95% CI 3.99 to 10.69; P<.001 and guided: differences between pre and post-treatment ESS=9.97; Cohen d=0.88; 95% CI 5.36 to 14.57; P<.001) in both the self-help and guided ICBT groups reduced significantly after treatment, with no significant differences between the two intervention groups. Across all the ICBT sessions, the only significant predictors of reductions in shame proneness were the average number of words participants wrote in the exposure module (beta=.222; SE 0.175; t96=2.317; P=.023) and gender (beta=-.33; SE 0.002; t77=-3.13; P=.002). We also found a mediation effect, wherein reductions in shame fully mediated the relationship between the average number of words participants wrote in the exposure module and reductions in social anxiety symptoms (SIAS: beta=-.0049; SE 0.0016; 95% CI -0.0085 to -0.0019 and SPS: beta=-.0039; SE 0.0015; 95% CI -0.0075 to -0.0012).
CONCLUSIONS


The findings of this study suggest that participants' engagement in the exposure module in ICBT alleviates social anxiety symptoms by reducing the levels of shame proneness. Our study provides a new perspective for understanding the role of shame in the treatment of social anxiety.

287,32347804,Using the Preparation Phase of the Multiphase Optimization Strategy to Develop a Messaging Component for Weight Loss: Formative and Pilot Research.,"BACKGROUND


Mobile messaging is often used in behavioral weight loss interventions, yet little is known as to the extent to which they contribute to weight loss when part of a multicomponent treatment package. The multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) is a framework that researchers can use to systematically investigate interventions that achieve desirable outcomes given specified constraints.
OBJECTIVE


This study describes the use of MOST to develop a messaging intervention as a component to test as part of a weight loss treatment package in a subsequent optimization trial.
METHODS


On the basis of our conceptual model, a text message intervention was created to support self-regulation of weight-related behaviors. We tested the messages in the ENLIGHTEN feasibility pilot study. Adults with overweight and obesity were recruited to participate in an 8-week weight loss program. Participants received a commercially available self-monitoring smartphone app, coaching calls, and text messages. The number and frequency of text messages sent were determined by individual preferences, and weight was assessed at 8 weeks.
RESULTS


Participants (n=9) in the feasibility pilot study lost 3.2% of their initial body weight over the 8-week intervention and preferred to receive 1.8 texts per day for 4.3 days per week. Researcher burden in manually sending messages was high, and the cost of receiving text messages was a concern. Therefore, a fully automated push notification system was developed to facilitate sending tailored daily messages to participants to support weight loss.
CONCLUSIONS


Following the completion of specifying the conceptual model and the feasibility pilot study, the message intervention went through a final iteration. Theory and feasibility pilot study results during the preparation phase informed critical decisions about automation, frequency, triggers, and content before inclusion as a treatment component in a factorial optimization trial.

288,32347805,Usability of Food Size Aids in Mobile Dietary Reporting Apps for Young Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND


Young adults are more likely to use self-managed dietary reporting apps. However, there is scant research examining the user experience of different measurement approaches for mobile dietary reporting apps when dealing with a wide variety of food shapes and container sizes.
OBJECTIVE


Field user experience testing was conducted under actual meal conditions to assess the accuracy, efficiency, and subjective reaction of three food portion measurement methods embedded in a developed mobile app. Key-in-based aid (KBA), commonly used in many current apps, relies on the user's ability to key in volumes or weights. Photo-based aid (PBA) extends traditional assessment methods, allowing users to scroll, observe, and select a reduced-size image from a set of options. Gesture-based aid (GBA) is a new experimental approach in which the user makes finger movements on the screen to roughly describe food portion boundaries accompanied by a background reference.
METHODS


A group of 124 young adults aged 19 to 26 years was recruited for a head-to-head randomized comparison and divided into 3 groups: a KBA (n=42) control group and PBA (n=41) and GBA (n=41) experimental groups. In total, 3 meals (ie, breakfast, lunch, and dinner) were served in a university cafeteria. Participants were provided with 25 dishes and beverages for selection, with a variety of food shapes and containers that reflect everyday life conditions. The accuracy of and time spent on realistic interaction during food portion estimation and the subjective reaction of each aid were recorded and analyzed.
RESULTS


Participants in the KBA group provided the highest accuracy in terms of hash brown weight (P=.004) and outperformed PBA or GBA for many soft drinks in cups. PBA had the best results for a cylindrical hot dog (P<.001), irregularly shaped pork chop (P<.001), and green tea beverage (660 mL; P<.001). GBA outperformed PBA for most drinks, and GBA outperformed KBA for some vegetables. The GBA group spent significantly more time assessing food items than the KBA and PBA groups. For each aid, the overall subjective reaction based on the score of the System Usability Scale was not significantly different.
CONCLUSIONS


Experimental results show that each aid had some distinguishing advantages. In terms of user acceptance, participants considered all 3 aids to be usable. Furthermore, users' subjective opinions regarding measurement accuracy contradicted the empirical findings. Future work will consider the use of each aid based on food or container shape and integrate the various advantages of the 3 different aids for better results. Our findings on the use of portion size aids are based on realistic and diverse food items, providing a useful reference for future app improvement of an effective, evidence-based, and acceptable feature.

289,32347815,The Development and Evaluation of a Text Message Program to Prevent Perceived Insufficient Milk Among First-Time Mothers: Retrospective Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND


Several recent trials have examined the feasibility and efficacy of automated SMS text messaging to provide remote breastfeeding support to mothers, but these texting systems vary in terms of design features and outcomes examined.
OBJECTIVE


This study examined user engagement with and feedback on a theory-grounded SMS text messaging intervention intended to prevent perceived insufficient milk (PIM)-the single, leading modifiable cause of unintended breastfeeding reduction and cessation.
METHODS


We recruited 250 nulliparous individuals intending to breastfeed between 13 and 25 weeks of pregnancy in southwestern Pennsylvania. Participants were randomly assigned with equal allocation to either an SMS intervention to prevent PIM and unintended breastfeeding reduction or cessation (MILK, a Mobile, semiautomated text message-based Intervention to prevent perceived Low or insufficient milK supply; n=126) or a control group receiving general perinatal SMS text messaging-based support via the national, free Text4Baby system (n=124). Participants in both groups received SMS text messages 3 to 7 times per week from 25 weeks of pregnancy to 8 weeks postpartum. The MILK intervention incorporated several automated interactivity and personalization features (eg, keyword texting for more detailed information on topics and branched response logic) as well as an option to receive one-on-one assistance from an on-call study lactation consultant. We examined participant interactions with the MILK system, including response rates to SMS text messaging queries. We also sought participant feedback on MILK content, delivery preferences, and overall satisfaction with the system via interviews and a remote survey at 8 weeks postpartum.
RESULTS


Participants randomized to MILK (87/124, 70.2% white and 84/124, 67.7% college educated) reported that MILK texts increased their breastfeeding confidence and helped them persevere through breastfeeding problems. Of 124 participants, 9 (7.3%) elected to stop MILK messages, and 3 (2.4%) opted to reduce message frequency during the course of the study. There were 46 texts through the MILK system for individualized assistance from the study lactation consultant (25/46, 54% on weekends or after-hours). The most commonly texted keywords for more detailed information occurred during weeks 4 to 6 postpartum and addressed milk volume intake and breastfeeding and sleep patterns. MILK participants stated a preference for anticipatory guidance on potential breastfeeding issues and less content addressing the benefits of breastfeeding. Suggested improvements included extending messaging past 8 weeks, providing access to messaging for partners, and tailoring content based on participants' pre-existing breastfeeding knowledge and unique breastfeeding trajectory.
CONCLUSIONS


Prenatal and postpartum evidence-based breastfeeding support delivered via semiautomated SMS text messaging is a feasible and an acceptable intervention for first-time mothers. To optimize engagement with digital breastfeeding interventions, enhanced customization features should be considered.

290,32347885,Effect of Evolocumab on Type and Size of Subsequent Myocardial Infarction: A Prespecified Analysis of the FOURIER Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Importance


The PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab reduced major vascular events in the Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial, yet the types and sizes of myocardial outcomes in FOURIER have not been previously explored.
Objective


To assess the types and sizes of myocardial infarction (MI) and the effect of evolocumab on MI by subtype.
Design, Setting, and Participants


A prespecified analysis of a multicenter double-blind randomized clinical trial. Patients were randomized to evolocumab or placebo and followed up for a median of 2.2 years. The study included 27 564 patients with stable atherosclerotic disease receiving statin therapy. Clinical end points were evaluated by the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction clinical events committee. Rates presented are 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimates. Data were collected from 2013 to 2016 and analyzed from June 2017 to December 2019.
Main Outcomes and Measures


Myocardial infarction was defined based on the third universal MI definition, and further classified according to MI type (universal MI subclass, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] vs non-STEMI) and by MI size (determined by peak troponin level).
Results


A total of 27 564 patients were randomized, with a mean (SD) age of 62.5 (9.0) years, and 20 795 (75%) were male. Of these, 1107 patients experienced a total of 1288 MIs. Most MIs (68%) were atherothrombotic (type 1), with 15% from myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch (type 2) and 15% percutaneous coronary intervention-related (type 4). Sudden death (type 3) and coronary artery bypass grafting-related (type 5) accounted for a total of 21 MIs (<2%). Evolocumab significantly reduced the risk of first MI by 27% (4.4% vs 6.3%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.65-0.82; P < .001), type 1 by 32% (2.9% vs 4.5%; HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.59-0.79; P < .001), and type 4 by 35% (0.8% vs 1.1%; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48-0.87; P = .004), with no effect on type 2 (0.9% vs 0.8%; HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.82-1.45; P = .56). Most MIs (688 [59.8%]) had troponin levels greater than or equal to 10 times the upper limit of normal. The benefit was highly significant and consistent regardless of the size of MI with a 34% reduction in MIs with troponin level greater than or equal to 10 times the upper limit of normal (2.6% vs 3.7%; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.56-0.77; P < .001) and a 36% reduction in the risk of STEMI (1.0% vs 1.5%; HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49-0.84; P < .001).
Conclusions and Relevance


Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering with evolocumab was highly effective in reducing the risk of MI. This reduction with evolocumab included benefit across multiple subtypes of MI related to plaque rupture, smaller and larger MIs, and both STEMI and non-STEMI. These data are consistent with the known benefit of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering and underscore the reduction in clinically meaningful events.

291,32347887,An Exploratory Analysis of Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 Inhibition and Aortic Stenosis in the FOURIER Trial.,"Importance


Despite recent advances in treatment of severe aortic valve stenosis (AS), AS remains a life-threatening condition with no proven disease-modifying therapy. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) have been implicated in the pathobiology of AS. The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor evolocumab reduces circulating LDL-C concentrations by 50% to 60% and Lp(a) by 20% to 30%.
Objective


To determine whether evolocumab reduces the risk of AS events in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
Interventions


Patients were randomized 1:1 to evolocumab or placebo.
Design, Setting, and Participants


Exploratory analysis of the FOURIER trial, which enrolled 27 564 patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who were taking statin therapy at 1242 sites in 49 countries from February 2013 to November 2016. Patients were randomized to evolocumab or placebo and followed up for a median (interquartile range) of 2.2 (1.8-2.5) years. This post hoc analysis was performed from September 2019 to February 2020.
Main Outcomes and Measures


Site-reported adverse events of new or worsening AS or aortic valve replacement (termed AS events). The adjusted risk of AS events was calculated with a multivariable model including concentrations of Lp(a) and LDL-C corrected for Lp(a) content, plus age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, current smoking, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Evolocumab efficacy was tested using a Cox proportional hazards model.
Results


Aortic stenosis events occurred in 63 patients (48 men [76%]; mean [SD] age, 69 [9] years) over a median of 2.2 years. Elevated Lp(a) concentration was associated with higher rates of AS events (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.55 [95% CI, 1.17-2.05] per SD; P = .002), including aortic valve replacement (aHR, 2.22 [95% CI, 1.38-3.58] per SD; P = .001), after multivariable adjustment. The corrected LDL-C concentration was not significantly associated with AS events (aHR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.93-1.61] per SD; P = .14). The overall HR for AS events with evolocumab was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.40-1.09), with no apparent association in the first year (HR, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.48-2.47]) but an HR of 0.48 (95% CI, 0.25-0.93) after the first year of treatment.
Conclusions and Relevance


In this exploratory analysis of the FOURIER trial, higher Lp(a) levels, but not Lp(a)-corrected LDL-C levels, were associated with a higher risk of subsequent AS events, including aortic valve replacement. Long-term therapy with evolocumab may reduce AS events, and this raises the possibility that specific pharmacologic lipid-lowering therapy could offer a means to prevent or slow the progression of AS. These exploratory findings merit further investigation with a dedicated randomized clinical trial.

292,32347899,Effect of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Antagonist on Risk of Committing Child Sexual Abuse in Men With Pedophilic Disorder: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Importance


Evidence-based treatments from randomized clinical trials for pedophilic disorder are lacking.
Objective


To determine whether a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist reduces dynamic risk factors for committing child sexual abuse.
Design, Setting, and Participants


This academically initiated, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 2 randomized clinical trial was conducted at the ANOVA center in Stockholm, Sweden, from March 1, 2016, to April 30, 2019. Individuals who contacted PrevenTell, the national telephone helpline for unwanted sexuality, were recruited. Eligible participants were men seeking help aged 18 to 66 years with a pedophilic disorder diagnosis and no contraindications to the intervention. The primary end point was assessed by intent-to-treat analysis.
Interventions


Randomization to receive either 2 subcutaneous injections of 120 mg of degarelix acetate or equal volume of placebo.
Main Outcomes and Measures


The primary end point was the mean change between baseline and 2 weeks in the composite risk score of 5 domains of child sexual abuse ranging from 0 to 15 points; each domain could be rated from 0 to 3 points. Secondary end points included efficacy at 2 and 10 weeks as measured by the composite score, each risk domain, quality of life, self-reported effects, and adverse events.
Results


A total of 52 male participants (mean [SD] age, 36 [12] years) were randomized to receive either degarelix (n = 25; with 1 withdrawal) or placebo (n = 26). At 2 weeks, the composite risk score decreased from 7.4 to 4.4 for participants in the degarelix group and from 7.8 to 6.6 for the placebo group, a mean between-group difference of -1.8 (95% CI, -3.2 to -0.5; P = .01). A decrease was seen in the composite score at 10 weeks (-2.2 [95% CI, -3.6 to -0.7]) as well as in the domains of pedophilic disorder (2 weeks: -0.7 [95% CI, -1.4 to 0.0]; 10 weeks: -1.1 [95% CI, -1.8 to -0.4]) and sexual preoccupation (2 weeks: -0.7 [95% CI, -1.2 to -0.3]; 10 weeks: -0.8 [95% CI, -1.3 to -0.3]) in the degarelix group compared with the placebo group. No difference was seen for the domains of self-rated risk (2 weeks: -0.4 [95% CI, -0.9 to 0.1]; 10 weeks: -0.5 [95% CI, -1 to 0.0]), low empathy (2 weeks: 0.2 [95% CI, -0.3 to 0.6]; 10 weeks: 0.2 [95% CI, -0.2 to 0.6]), and impaired self-regulation (2 weeks: -0.0 [95% CI, -0.7 to 0.6]; 10 weeks: 0.1 [95% CI, -0.5 to 0.8]), or quality of life (EuroQol 5 Dimensions questionnaire index score, 2 weeks: 0.06 [95% CI, -0.00 to 0.12], and 10 weeks: 0.04; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.10; EuroQol visual analog scale, 2 weeks: 0.6 [95% CI, -9.7 to 10.9], and 10 weeks: 4.2 [95% CI, -6.0 to 14.4]). Two hospitalizations occurred from increased suicidal ideation, and more injection site reactions (degarelix: 22 of 25 [88%]; placebo: 1 of 26 [4%]) and hepatobiliary enzyme level elevations were reported by participants who received degarelix (degarelix: 11 of 25 [44%]; placebo: 2 of 26 [8%]). Among the 26 participants randomized to receive degarelix, 20 (77%) experienced positive effects (eg, improved attitude or behavior) on sexuality and 23 (89%) reported adverse effects on the body.
Conclusion and Relevance


This trial found that degarelix reduced the risk score for committing child sexual abuse in men with pedophilic disorder 2 weeks after initial injection, suggesting use of the drug as a rapid-onset treatment option. Further studies are warranted into the effects and long-term adverse effects of hormone deficiency.

294,32348286,Digital Smoking Cessation for Heavy Drinkers: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND


Heavy drinking (HD) is far more common among smokers compared with nonsmokers and interferes with successful smoking cessation. Alcohol-focused smoking cessation interventions delivered by counselors have shown promise, but digital versions of these interventions-which could have far greater population reach-have not yet been tested.
OBJECTIVE


This pilot randomized controlled trial aimed to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and effect sizes of an automated digital smoking cessation program that specifically addresses HD using an interactive web-based intervention with an optional text messaging component.
METHODS


Participants (83/119, 69.7% female; 98/119, 82.4% white; mean age 38.0 years) were daily smokers recruited on the web from a free automated digital smoking cessation program (BecomeAnEX.org, EX) who met the criteria for HD: women drinking 8+ drinks/week or 4+ drinks on any day and men drinking 15+ drinks/week or 5+ drinks on any day. Participants were randomized to receive EX with standard content (EX-S) or an EX with additional content specific to HD (EX-HD). Outcomes were assessed by web-based surveys at 1 and 6 months.
RESULTS


Participants reported high satisfaction with the website and the optional text messaging component. Total engagement with both EX-S and EX-HD was modest, with participants visiting the website a median of 2 times, and 52.9% of the participants enrolled to receive text messages. Participants in both the conditions showed substantial, significant reductions in drinking across 6 months of follow-up, with no condition effects observed. Although smoking outcomes tended to favor EX-HD, the condition effects were small and nonsignificant. A significantly smaller proportion of participants in EX-HD reported having a lapse back to smoking when drinking alcohol (7/58, 16%) compared with those in EX-S (18/61, 41%; χ21=6.2; P=.01).
CONCLUSIONS


This is the first trial to examine a digital smoking cessation program tailored to HD smokers. The results provide some initial evidence that delivering such a program is feasible and may reduce the risk of alcohol-involved smoking lapses. However, increasing engagement in this and other web-based interventions is a crucial challenge to address in future work.

295,32348291,The Design of A Clinical Trial to Increase Self-Monitoring of Physical Activity and Eating Behaviors Among Adolescents: Protocol for the ImPACT Feasibility Study.,"BACKGROUND


Severe obesity among the youth (BMI for age ≥120th percentile) has been steadily increasing. The home environment and parental behavioral modeling are two of the strongest predictors of child weight loss during weight-loss interventions, which highlights that a family-based treatment approach is warranted. This strategy has been successful in our existing evidence-based pediatric weight management program, Brenner Families in Training (Brenner FIT). However, this program relies on face-to-face encounters, which are limited by the time constraints of the families enrolled in treatment.
OBJECTIVE


This study aims to refine and test a tailored suite of mobile health (mHealth) components to augment an existing evidence-based pediatric weight management program.
METHODS


Study outcomes will include acceptability from a patient and clinical staff perspective, feasibility, and economic costs relative to the established weight management protocol alone (ie, Brenner FIT vs Brenner FIT + mHealth [Brenner mFIT]). The Brenner mFIT intervention will consist of six mHealth components designed to increase patient and caregiver exposure to Brenner FIT programmatic content including the following: (1) a mobile-enabled website, (2) dietary and physical activity tracking, (3) caregiver podcasts (n=12), (4) animated videos (n=6) for adolescent patients, (5) interactive messaging, and (6) in-person tailored clinical feedback provided based-upon a Web-based dashboard. For the study, 80 youths with obesity (aged 13-18 years) and caregiver dyads will be randomized to Brenner FIT or Brenner mFIT. All participants will complete baseline measures before randomization and at 3- and 6-month follow-up points.
RESULTS


This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board in July 2019, funded in August 2019, and will commence enrollment in April 2020. The results of the study are expected to be published in the fall/winter of 2021.

297,32348638,Utilization trends of respiratory medication in premature infants discharged on home oxygen therapy.,"BACKGROUND


Roughly half of all extremely preterm infants will be diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and a third will be discharged on home oxygen therapy (HOT). To date, there have been no studies that have examined the relationship between respiratory medication utilization in infants with BPD on HOT.
METHODS


The recorded home oximetry trial was a multicenter, randomized trial comparing two home oxygen management strategies in premature infants. Infants were enrolled at first outpatient pulmonary or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) follow-up visit with a pulmonary component. Respiratory medication prescriptions and dosage were collected from time of enrollment through 6 months after HOT discontinuation. Patients were seen monthly while on HOT and at 1, 3, and 6 months after successful discontinuation.
RESULTS


During protocol visits, 174 (89%) infants had respiratory medications documented. Respiratory medication use was higher at initial follow-up visit compared with NICU discharge and decreased at the final 6-month follow-up visit. Infants who received inhaled steroids (IS) before weaning had mean HOT duration of 138 days (range: 24-562 days); infants who received IS after weaning had shorter mean HOT duration (55 days, range: 21-264). In time-to-event analysis the no IS group and the postwean group differed significantly (χ 2   1   = 8.1; P = .004). NICU clinics gave a total of 35 prescriptions to 43 patients, an average of 0.8 per patient, while the pulmonary clinics gave 837 prescriptions to 153 patients, or 5.5 per patient (P < .0001).
CONCLUSION


Respiratory prescribing patterns for infants on HOT are highly variable.

298,32348688,"Effect of strength training and antioxidant supplementation on perceived and performance fatigability of breast cancer survivors - A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study.","This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study aimed to investigate the effect of strength training (ST) combined with vitamin C and E supplementation on perceived and performance fatigability in breast cancer survivors (BCS). Twenty-five BCS were randomly assigned to one of two groups: vitamins (VIT; n = 12; 51.0 ± 9.0 years); or placebo (PLA; n = 13; 48.2 ± 8.3 years). Both groups performed a 10-week ST protocol, twice a week. VIT was supplemented with vitamins C (500mg/day) and E (180mg/day) and PLA with polydextrose (1g/day), once a day after breakfast. At the beginning and at the end of training period, perceived fatigability was assessed using MFI-20 (general fatigue and physical fatigue). Performance fatigability was assessed during 30 maximal isokinetic knee extension at 120º/s-1. General fatigue reduced similarly in VIT (p = 0.004) and PLA (p = 0.011). Physical fatigue reduced similarly in both, VIT (p = 0.011) and PLA (p = 0.001). Performance fatigability also decreased similarly in VIT (p = 0.026) and PLA (p < 0.001).

299,32348739,Limited Efficacy of Thrombolytics for Pump Thrombosis in Durable Left Ventricular Assist Devices.,"BACKGROUND


This study reports a single center experience with thrombolytics for left ventricular assist device (LVAD) pump thrombosis.
METHODS


Adults undergoing continuous-flow LVAD implantation between 2004-2018 at a single center were reviewed and those with pump thrombosis identified. Primary outcomes included 1-year survival and success rates of thrombolytic therapy. Secondary outcomes included post-treatment adverse events, freedom from major bleeding at 1-year and freedom from stroke at 1-year follow-up.
RESULTS


341 patients underwent LVAD implantation and 10.8% (n=37) developed pump thrombosis. Of these 37, 26 (70.2%) received initial thrombolytic therapy, 5 (13.5%) underwent direct pump exchange, and 6 (16.2%) received only intravenous heparin due to presentation with acute stroke or severe multiorgan failure. Successful treatment was achieved in 11.5% (n=3) of patients receiving thrombolytics. Early adverse events following thrombolytic therapy included major bleeding in 11.5% (n=3) and new stroke in 7.7% (n=2). The majority of patients undergoing thrombolytic therapy underwent subsequent device exchange (69.2%; n=18). The overall survival in patients with pump thrombosis following treatment was 96.8% at 30-days, 78.9% at 90-days, and 63.1% at 1-year. The freedom from major bleeding and stroke at 1-year was 74.2% and 87.2%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS


In this single center experience of thrombolytics for pump thrombosis in LVAD patients, there was limited efficacy with the majority of patients requiring subsequent pump exchange. This combined with the risk of major bleeding or stroke with thrombolysis underscores the importance of further refining patient selection for direct pump exchange in those presenting with pump thrombosis.",2020,"The overall survival in patients with pump thrombosis following treatment was 96.8% at 30-days, 78.9% at 90-days, and 63.1% at 1-year.","['LVAD patients', '341 patients underwent', 'Adults undergoing continuous-flow LVAD implantation between 2004-2018 at a single center were reviewed and those with pump thrombosis identified']","['initial thrombolytic therapy', 'thrombolytic therapy', 'heparin', 'LVAD implantation']","['post-treatment adverse events, freedom from major bleeding at 1-year and freedom from stroke at 1-year follow-up', 'pump thrombosis', 'overall survival', '1-year survival and success rates of thrombolytic therapy', 'major bleeding', 'new stroke']","[{'cui': 'C0181598', 'cui_str': 'Left ventricular assist device'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0001675', 'cui_str': 'Adult'}, {'cui': 'C0549178', 'cui_str': 'Continuous'}, {'cui': 'C0021107', 'cui_str': 'Implantation procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0037179', 'cui_str': 'Single person'}, {'cui': 'C0205099', 'cui_str': 'Central'}, {'cui': 'C0282443', 'cui_str': 'Review'}, {'cui': 'C0182537', 'cui_str': 'Pump'}, {'cui': 'C0040053', 'cui_str': 'Thrombosis'}, {'cui': 'C0205396', 'cui_str': 'Identified'}]","[{'cui': 'C0205265', 'cui_str': 'Initial'}, {'cui': 'C0040044', 'cui_str': 'Thrombolytic therapy'}, {'cui': 'C0019134', 'cui_str': 'heparin'}, {'cui': 'C0181598', 'cui_str': 'Left ventricular assist device'}, {'cui': 'C0021107', 'cui_str': 'Implantation procedure'}]","[{'cui': 'C0687676', 'cui_str': 'After values'}, {'cui': 'C0039798', 'cui_str': 'therapy'}, {'cui': 'C0877248', 'cui_str': 'Adverse event'}, {'cui': 'C0016694', 'cui_str': 'Liberty'}, {'cui': 'C0205082', 'cui_str': 'Severe'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0038454', 'cui_str': 'Cerebrovascular accident'}, {'cui': 'C0589120', 'cui_str': 'Follow-up status'}, {'cui': 'C0182537', 'cui_str': 'Pump'}, {'cui': 'C0040053', 'cui_str': 'Thrombosis'}, {'cui': 'C0282416', 'cui_str': 'Overall'}, {'cui': 'C0038952', 'cui_str': 'Survival'}, {'cui': 'C0040044', 'cui_str': 'Thrombolytic therapy'}, {'cui': 'C0205314', 'cui_str': 'New'}]",341.0,0.223001,"The overall survival in patients with pump thrombosis following treatment was 96.8% at 30-days, 78.9% at 90-days, and 63.1% at 1-year.","[{'ForeName': 'Laura', 'Initials': 'L', 'LastName': 'Seese', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Cardiac Surgery.'}, {'ForeName': 'Gavin', 'Initials': 'G', 'LastName': 'Hickey', 'Affiliation': 'Heart and Vascular Institute,; Division of Cardiology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Mary', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Keebler', 'Affiliation': 'Heart and Vascular Institute,; Division of Cardiology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Floyd', 'Initials': 'F', 'LastName': 'Thoma', 'Affiliation': 'Heart and Vascular Institute.'}, {'ForeName': 'Arman', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Kilic', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Cardiac Surgery,; Heart and Vascular Institute,.

Physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) is reduced during, and energy intake is elevated after, a period of energy restriction, but whether these are altered in anticipation of energy restriction is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess energy intake and PAEE in the 24 h before severe energy restriction. In randomised, counterbalanced order, 14 healthy males completed two 48 h trials over 3 days. On day 1, participants were informed which diet they would receive on day 2; either an energy balanced diet providing 100% (2755 (159) kcal; EB) or an energy restricted diet providing 25% (691 (42) kcal; ER), of their estimated energy requirements. Throughout day 1, ad-libitum energy intake was then determined from researcher-provided breakfast (08:30-09:00), lunch (12:30-13:00), afternoon snacks (14:00-18:00) and dinner (19:30-20:00). On day 2, participants consumed their allocated diet as instructed. On day 3, ad-libitum energy intake was assessed at breakfast (08:30-09:00).

The following dependent variables were assessed: chemophobia, knowledge of basic toxicological principles, affect towards chemicals, benefit perception of the use of chemicals, and preference for natural substitutes in consumer products. The results showed that only the informational approach, which conveys knowledge of basic toxicological principles, significantly decreased chemophobia and the preference for natural substitutes in consumer products. The affect-based approach significantly increased positive affect towards chemicals and the benefit perception of their use, but did not decrease chemophobia. This suggested that the provision of relevant information about basic toxicological principles is a more effective strategy than merely addressing laypeople's affect towards chemicals to reduce chemophobia.

303,32347765,Design and Rationale of the Biomarker Center of the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) Trial.,"BACKGROUND


Biomarkers of exposure, susceptibility, and effect are fundamental for understanding environmental exposures, mechanistic pathways of effect, and monitoring early adverse outcomes. To date, no study has comprehensively evaluated a large suite and variety of biomarkers in household air pollution (HAP) studies in concert with exposure and outcome data. The Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial is a liquified petroleum gas (LPG) fuel/stove randomized intervention trial enrolling 800 pregnant women in each of four countries (i.e., Peru, Guatemala, Rwanda, and India). Their offspring will be followed from birth through 12 months of age to evaluate the role of pre- and postnatal exposure to HAP from biomass burning cookstoves in the control arm and LPG stoves in the intervention arm on growth and respiratory outcomes. In addition, up to 200 older adult women per site are being recruited in the same households to evaluate indicators of cardiopulmonary, metabolic, and cancer outcomes.
OBJECTIVES


Here we describe the rationale and ultimate design of a comprehensive biomarker plan to enable us to explore more fully how exposure is related to disease outcome.
METHODS


HAPIN enrollment and data collection began in May 2018 and will continue through August 2021. As a part of data collection, dried blood spot (DBS) and urine samples are being collected three times during pregnancy in pregnant women and older adult women. DBS are collected at birth for the child. DBS and urine samples are being collected from the older adult women and children three times throughout the child's first year of life. Exposure biomarkers that will be longitudinally measured in all participants include urinary hydroxy-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile organic chemical metabolites, metals/metalloids, levoglucosan, and cotinine. Biomarkers of effect, including inflammation, endothelial and oxidative stress biomarkers, lung cancer markers, and other clinically relevant measures will be analyzed in urine, DBS, or blood products from the older adult women. Similarly, genomic/epigenetic markers, microbiome, and metabolomics will be measured in older adult women samples.
DISCUSSION


Our study design will yield a wealth of biomarker data to evaluate, in great detail, the link between exposures and health outcomes. In addition, our design is comprehensive and innovative by including cutting-edge measures such as metabolomics and epigenetics. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5751.",2020,"The Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial is a liquified petroleum gas (LPG) fuel/stove randomized intervention trial enrolling 800 pregnant women in each of four countries (i.e., Peru, Guatemala, Rwanda, and India).","['older adult women', 'HAPIN enrollment and data collection began in May 2018 and will continue through August 2021', 'pregnant women and older adult women', '800 pregnant women in each of four countries (i.e., Peru, Guatemala, Rwanda, and India', '200 older adult women per site are being recruited in the same households to evaluate indicators of cardiopulmonary, metabolic, and cancer outcomes', 'older adult women samples']",['https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5751'],"['DBS and urine samples', 'inflammation, endothelial and oxidative stress biomarkers, lung cancer markers']","[{'cui': 'C0001792', 'cui_str': 'Elderly person'}, {'cui': 'C0043210', 'cui_str': 'Woman'}, {'cui': 'C0020052', 'cui_str': 'Households'}, {'cui': 'C0001873', 'cui_str': 'Air pollution'}, {'cui': 'C0184661', 'cui_str': 'Procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0150775', 'cui_str': 'Social Networks'}, {'cui': 'C0036369', 'cui_str': 'School Enrollment'}, {'cui': 'C0010995', 'cui_str': 'Data Collection'}, {'cui': 'C0439659', 'cui_str': 'Origins'}, {'cui': 'C0549178', 'cui_str': 'Continuous'}, {'cui': 'C0033011', 'cui_str': 'Pregnant woman'}, {'cui': 'C3844106', 'cui_str': '800'}, {'cui': 'C0454664', 'cui_str': 'Country'}, {'cui': 'C0031238', 'cui_str': 'Peru'}, {'cui': 'C0018367', 'cui_str': 'Guatemala'}, {'cui': 'C0035978', 'cui_str': 'Rwanda'}, {'cui': 'C0021201', 'cui_str': 'India'}, {'cui': 'C4319558', 'cui_str': '200'}, {'cui': 'C0205145', 'cui_str': 'Site'}, {'cui': 'C0021212', 'cui_str': 'Indicators'}, {'cui': 'C0006826', 'cui_str': 'Malignant neoplastic disease'}, {'cui': 'C1274040', 'cui_str': 'Result'}, {'cui': 'C0370003', 'cui_str': 'Specimen'}]",[],"[{'cui': 'C0011682', 'cui_str': 'Desiccation - action'}, {'cui': 'C0005767', 'cui_str': 'Blood'}, {'cui': 'C0015230', 'cui_str': 'Eruption'}, {'cui': 'C1610733', 'cui_str': 'Urine specimen'}, {'cui': 'C0021368', 'cui_str': 'Inflammation'}, {'cui': 'C0014257', 'cui_str': 'Structure of endothelium tissue'}, {'cui': 'C0242606', 'cui_str': 'Oxidative stress'}, {'cui': 'C0005516', 'cui_str': 'Biological Markers'}, {'cui': 'C0242379', 'cui_str': 'Malignant tumor of lung'}]",800.0,0.124554,"The Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial is a liquified petroleum gas (LPG) fuel/stove randomized intervention trial enrolling 800 pregnant women in each of four countries (i.e., Peru, Guatemala, Rwanda, and India).","[{'ForeName': 'Dana Boyd', 'Initials': 'DB', 'LastName': 'Barr', 'Affiliation': 'Gangarosa Department of Environmental Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Naveen', 'Initials': 'N', 'LastName': 'Puttaswamy', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Environmental Health Engineering, ICMR Center for Advanced Research on Air Quality, Climate and Health, Sri Ramachandra Institute for Higher Education and Research (Deemed University), Chennai, India.'}, {'ForeName': 'Lindsay M', 'Initials': 'LM', 'LastName': 'Jaacks', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard T.H.

304,32347766,Design and Rationale of the HAPIN Study: A Multicountry Randomized Controlled Trial to Assess the Effect of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Stove and Continuous Fuel Distribution.,"BACKGROUND


Globally, nearly 3 billion people rely on solid fuels for cooking and heating, the vast majority residing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The resulting household air pollution (HAP) is a leading environmental risk factor, accounting for an estimated 1.6 million premature deaths annually. Previous interventions of cleaner stoves have often failed to reduce exposure to levels that produce meaningful health improvements. There have been no multicountry field trials with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) stoves, likely the cleanest scalable intervention.

This paper describes the design and methods of an ongoing randomized controlled trial (RCT) of LPG stove and fuel distribution in 3,200 households in 4 LMICs (India, Guatemala, Peru, and Rwanda).
METHODS


We are enrolling 800 pregnant women at each of the 4 international research centers from households using biomass fuels. We are randomly assigning households to receive LPG stoves, an 18-month supply of free LPG, and behavioral reinforcements to the control arm. The mother is being followed along with her child until the child is 1 year old. Older adult women (40 to  < 80   years  of age) living in the same households are also enrolled and followed during the same period. Primary health outcomes are low birth weight, severe pneumonia incidence, stunting in the child, and high blood pressure (BP) in the older adult woman. Secondary health outcomes are also being assessed. We are assessing stove and fuel use, conducting repeated personal and kitchen exposure assessments of fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter  ≤ 2.5 μ m  ( PM 2.5 ), carbon monoxide (CO), and black carbon (BC), and collecting dried blood spots (DBS) and urinary samples for biomarker analysis. Enrollment and data collection began in May 2018 and will continue through August 2021. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02944682).
CONCLUSIONS


This study will provide evidence to inform national and global policies on scaling up LPG stove use among vulnerable populations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6407.",2020,"Primary health outcomes are low birth weight, severe pneumonia incidence, stunting in the child, and high blood pressure (BP) in the older adult woman.","['800 pregnant women at each of the 4 international research centers from households using biomass fuels', '3,200 households in 4 LMICs (India, Guatemala, Peru, and Rwanda', 'Older adult women (40 to  < 80 \u2009 years  of age) living in the same households are also enrolled and followed during the same period']","['Liquefied Petroleum Gas Stove and Continuous Fuel Distribution', 'LPG stoves', 'LPG stove and fuel distribution']","['low birth weight, severe pneumonia incidence, stunting in the child, and high blood pressure (BP', 'household air pollution (HAP', 'carbon monoxide (CO), and black carbon (BC), and collecting dried blood spots (DBS) and urinary samples for biomarker analysis']","[{'cui': 'C3844106', 'cui_str': '800'}, {'cui': 'C0033011', 'cui_str': 'Pregnant woman'}, {'cui': 'C0242481', 'cui_str': 'Research Activities'}, {'cui': 'C0205099', 'cui_str': 'Central'}, {'cui': 'C0020052', 'cui_str': 'Households'}, {'cui': 'C0005535', 'cui_str': 'Biomass'}, {'cui': 'C0556991', 'cui_str': 'Fuel'}, {'cui': 'C0021201', 'cui_str': 'India'}, {'cui': 'C0018367', 'cui_str': 'Guatemala'}, {'cui': 'C0031238', 'cui_str': 'Peru'}, {'cui': 'C0035978', 'cui_str': 'Rwanda'}, {'cui': 'C0001792', 'cui_str': 'Elderly person'}, {'cui': 'C0043210', 'cui_str': 'Woman'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0595998', 'cui_str': 'Household composition'}, {'cui': 'C0231290', 'cui_str': 'Status post'}]","[{'cui': 'C0303763', 'cui_str': 'Liquefied petroleum gas'}, {'cui': 'C0336754', 'cui_str': 'Stove'}, {'cui': 'C0549178', 'cui_str': 'Continuous'}, {'cui': 'C0556991', 'cui_str': 'Fuel'}, {'cui': 'C0037775', 'cui_str': 'Distributions'}]","[{'cui': 'C0024032', 'cui_str': 'Low Birth Weights'}, {'cui': 'C0205082', 'cui_str': 'Severe'}, {'cui': 'C0032285', 'cui_str': 'Pneumonia'}, {'cui': 'C0021149', 'cui_str': 'Incidence'}, {'cui': 'C0018273', 'cui_str': 'Growth disorder'}, {'cui': 'C0008059', 'cui_str': 'Child'}, {'cui': 'C0020538', 'cui_str': 'Hypertensive disorder'}, {'cui': 'C0020052', 'cui_str': 'Households'}, {'cui': 'C0001873', 'cui_str': 'Air pollution'}, {'cui': 'C0007018', 'cui_str': 'Carbon Monoxide'}, {'cui': 'C0007010', 'cui_str': 'Carbon Black'}, {'cui': 'C0011682', 'cui_str': 'Desiccation -

305,32347767,Post hoc analysis of reactogenicity trends between dose 1 and dose 2 of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine in two parallel randomized trials.,"In two large clinical trials (ZOE-50 [NCT01165177] and ZOE-70 [NCT01165229]), two doses of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) demonstrated >90% efficacy against herpes zoster in adults ≥50 years of age. Solicited adverse events (AEs) were collected for 7 days post-each dose in a study sub-cohort. The incidence of reported solicited AEs was higher for RZV compared to placebo recipients. Since reactogenicity may contribute to a person's willingness to be vaccinated, knowing about expected reactogenicity might help keep high compliance with the second dose. This post hoc analysis assessed the intensity of solicited AEs post-dose 2 reported to the same event's intensity post-dose 1. Intensity was graded from 0 to 3, grade 3 indicating the highest severity. Of the vaccinees who did not experience a specific AE post-dose 1, 72.6-91.7% did not experience the same event after dose 2. Although the frequency of grade 3 AEs post-dose 2 was the highest in participants reporting the same AEs at grade 3 post-dose 1, 65.8-89.3% of vaccinees with grade 3 specific AEs post-dose 1 reported the same AEs at lower intensity post-dose 2.

307,32343642,"Irinotecan, Temozolomide, and Dinutuximab With GM-CSF in Children With Refractory or Relapsed Neuroblastoma: A Report From the Children's Oncology Group.","PURPOSE


The combination of irinotecan, temozolomide, dintuximab, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (I/T/DIN/GM-CSF) demonstrated activity in patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma in the randomized Children's Oncology Group ANBL1221 trial. To more accurately assess response rate and toxicity, an expanded cohort was nonrandomly assigned to I/T/DIN/GM-CSF.
PATIENTS AND METHODS


Patients were eligible at first relapse or first designation of refractory disease. Oral T and intravenous (IV) irinotecan were administered on days 1 to 5 of 21-day cycles. DIN was administered IV (days 2-5), and GM-CSF was administered subcutaneously (days 6-12). The primary end point was objective response, analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis per the International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria.
RESULTS


Seventeen eligible patients were randomly assigned to I/T/DIN/GM-CSF (February 2013 to March 2015); 36 additional patients were nonrandomly assigned to I/T/DIN/GM-CSF (August 2016 to May 2017). Objective (complete or partial) responses were observed in nine (52.9%) of 17 randomly assigned patients (95% CI, 29.2% to 76.7%) and 13 (36.1%) of 36 expansion patients (95% CI, 20.4% to 51.8%). Objective responses were seen in 22 (41.5%) of 53 patients overall (95% CI, 28.2% to 54.8%); stable disease was also observed in 22 of 53. One-year progression-free and overall survival for all patients receiving I/T/DIN/GM-CSF were 67.9% ± 6.4% (95% CI, 55.4% to 80.5%) and 84.9% ± 4.9% (95% CI, 75.3% to 94.6%), respectively. Two patients did not receive protocol therapy and were evaluable for response but not toxicity. Common grade ≥ 3 toxicities were fever/infection (18 [35.3%] of 51), neutropenia (17 [33.3%] of 51), pain (15 [29.4%] of 51), and diarrhea (10 [19.6%] of 51). One patient met protocol-defined criteria for unacceptable toxicity (grade 4 hypoxia). Higher DIN trough levels were associated with response.
CONCLUSION

308,32343765,A diversified dietary pattern is associated with a balanced gut microbial composition of Faecalibacterium and Escherichia/Shigella in patients with Crohn's disease in remission.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS


Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with alterations in gut microbial composition and function. This controlled-intervention study investigated the relationship between patterns of dietary intake and baseline gut microbiota in CD patients in remission and examined the effects of a dietary intervention in patients consuming a non-diversified diet (NDD).
METHODS


Forty outpatients with quiescent CD were recruited in Calgary, Alberta Canada. Based on 3-day food records, patients consuming a lower plant-based and higher red and processed meat-based diet were assigned to the NDD group (n=15) and received a 12-week structured dietary intervention; all other patients were assigned to the diversified diet (DD) control group (n=25) and received conventional management. Fecal microbiota composition, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and calprotectin were measured.
RESULTS


At baseline NDD and DD groups had a different fecal microbial beta-diversity (p=0.003, PERMANOVA). NDD group had lower Faecalibacterium and higher Escherichia/Shigella relative abundances compared to the DD group (3.3±5.4% vs. 8.5±10.6%; 6.9±12.2% vs. 1.6±4.4%; p≤0.03, ANCOVA). These two genera showed a strong negative correlation (rs= -0.60, q=0.0002). Fecal butyrate demonstrated a positive correlation with Faecalibacterium (rs=0.52, q=0.002), and an inhibitory relationship with Escherichia/Shigella abundance (four-parameter sigmoidal model, R= -0.83; rs= -0.44, q=0.01), respectively. After the 12 weeks dietary intervention, no difference in microbial beta-diversity between the two groups was observed (p=0.43). The NDD group demonstrated an increase in Faecalibacterium (p<0.05, GEE), and resembled the DD group at the end of the intervention (p=0.84, t-test with permutation). We did not find association of diet with fecal SCFAs or calprotectin.
CONCLUSIONS


Dietary patterns are associated with specific gut microbial compositions in CD patients in remission. A diet intervention in patients consuming a NDD modifies gut microbial composition to resemble that seen in patients consuming a DD. These results identify that diet is important in shaping the microbial dysbiosis signature in CD towards a balanced community.",2020,"The NDD group demonstrated an increase in Faecalibacterium

309,32343855,Utility of the QTA30 in a school medical checkup for adolescent students.,"BACKGROUND


In adolescence, physical symptoms may develop due to psychosocial problems, but such problems are not fully evaluated in school medical checkups. The aim of the study was to compare the characteristics of students with high and low scores on the Questionnaire for Triage and Assessment with 30 items (QTA30) in a school health checkup.
METHODS


The QTA30 (a self-completed questionnaire) was used in checkups for 3,414 students from 5th grade of primary schools to 3rd grade of junior high schools in south Wakayama Prefecture. The students were divided into groups with high (QTA30 ≥37) and low (QTA30 <37) risk for psychosomatic disorder. Eleven items, including gender, grade, lifestyle habits, and life events, were compared between these groups, and in subgroups with and without recent absence from school.
RESULTS


The QTA30 response rate was 87.9%. The high risk group had significantly more 3rd grade students (p<0.001), females (p<0.001), problems with teachers or friends (p<0.001), and experience of bullying (p<0.001), in addition to game playing for ≥2 hours (p<0.001), late bedtime (p<0.001), and many absences (p<0.001). Students in the high risk group with no absences for one month regardless of age still had a late bedtime and problems with friends, and 76.4% of the high-risk students had not visited a medical institution.
CONCLUSIONS


Use of the QTA30 facilitated detection of psychosomatic stress in school medical checkups, with latent risks of truancy detectable at an early phase. Thus, the QTA30 may be useful in early intervention for psychosomatic stress of adolescents.",2020,"The high risk group had significantly more 3rd grade students (p<0.001), females (p<0.001), problems with teachers or friends (p<0.001), and experience of bullying (p<0.001), in addition to game playing for ≥2 hours (p<0.001), late bedtime (p<0.001), and many absences (p<0.001).","['3,414 students from 5th grade of primary schools to 3rd grade of junior high schools in south Wakayama Prefecture', 'Students in the high risk group with no absences for one month regardless of age still had a late bedtime and problems with friends, and 76.4% of the high-risk students had not visited a medical institution', 'students with high and low scores on the Questionnaire for Triage and Assessment with 30 items (QTA30) in a school health checkup', 'adolescent students']",['QTA30'],['QTA30 response rate'],"[{'cui': 'C0038492', 'cui_str': 'Student'}, {'cui': 'C0205439', 'cui_str': 'Fifth'}, {'cui': 'C0441800', 'cui_str': 'Grade'}, {'cui': 'C0033145', 'cui_str': 'Primary school'}, {'cui': 'C0205437', 'cui_str': 'Third'}, {'cui': 'C0205250', 'cui_str': 'High'}, {'cui': 'C0036375', 'cui_str': 'School'}, {'cui': 'C0332167', 'cui_str': 'High risk of'}, {'cui': 'C0439745', 'cui_str': 'Grouped'}, {'cui': 'C0332197', 'cui_str': 'Absent'}, {'cui': 'C4082115', 'cui_str': 'One month'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0205087', 'cui_str': 'Late'}, {'cui': 'C0521112', 'cui_str': 'Bedtime'}, {'cui': 'C0033213', 'cui_str': 'Problem'}, {'cui': 'C0079382', 'cui_str': 'Friend'}, {'cui': 'C0199168', 'cui_str': 'Medical service'}, {'cui': 'C0018704', 'cui_str': 'Healthcare facility'}, {'cui': 'C0205251', 'cui_str': 'Low'}, {'cui': 'C0449820', 'cui_str': 'Score'}, {'cui': 'C0034394', 'cui_str': 'Questionnaires'}, {'cui': 'C0040861', 'cui_str': 'Triage'}, {'cui': 'C0031809', 'cui_str': 'Physical examination'}, {'cui': 'C0036372', 'cui_str': 'Nursing, School'}, {'cui': 'C0205653', 'cui_str': 'Adolescent'}]","[{'cui': 'C0034394', 'cui_str': 'Questionnaires'}, {'cui': 'C0040861', 'cui_str': 'Triage'}, {'cui': 'C0031809', 'cui_str': 'Physical examination'}]","[{'cui': 'C0034394', 'cui_str': 'Questionnaires'}, {'cui': 'C0040861', 'cui_str': 'Triage'}, {'cui': 'C0031809', 'cui_str': 'Physical examination'}]",3414.0,0.0273128,"The high risk group had significantly more 3rd grade students (p<0.001), females (p<0.001), problems with teachers or friends (p<0.001), and experience of bullying (p<0.001), in addition to game playing for ≥2 hours (p<0.001), late bedtime (p<0.001), and many absences (p<0.001).","[{'ForeName': 'Chizu', 'Initials': 'C', 'LastName': 'Habukawa', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Allergy, Minami Wakayama Medical Center, Tanabe, Wakayama-ken, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Shinichiro', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Nagamitsu', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Kurume University, Kurume, Fukuoka-ken, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kenshi', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Koyanagi', 'Affiliation': 'Nagasaki Prefectural Center of Medicine and Welfare for Children, Isahaya, Nagasaki-ken, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Yumi', 'Initials': 'Y', 'LastName': 'Nishikii', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagasaki Hospital, Isahaya, Nagasaki-ken, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Yoshitoki', 'Initials': 'Y', 'LastName': 'Yanagimoto', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Kansai Medical University, Nagasaki, Nagasaki-ken, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Yoshida', 'Initials': 'Y', 'LastName': 'Seiji', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki, Osaka-fu, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Yuichi', 'Initials': 'Y', 'LastName': 'Suzuki', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, Fukushima, Fukushima-ken, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Soken', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Go', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Katsumi', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Murakami', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychosomatic medicine, Sakai Sakibana Hospital, Sakai, Osaka-fu, Japan.'}]",Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,['10.1111/ped.14268']
310,32343882,High Serum Interleukin-6 is Associated With Severe Progression of Rheumatoid Arthritis and Increased Treatment Response Differentiating Sarilumab from Adalimumab or Methotrexate in a Post Hoc Analysis.,"OBJECTIVES


The development of biomarkers to guide treatment decisions is a major research focus in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients with RA have elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels; however, the utility of IL-6 as a predictor of treatment response is unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate, by post hoc analysis, whether baseline IL-6 levels could predict sarilumab treatment responses in two phase III studies.
METHODS


Serum IL-6 concentrations were measured in patients with RA prior to receiving sarilumab 200 mg (n = 148) or adalimumab 40 mg (n = 152) every two weeks (Q2W) (MONARCH, NCT02332590) or sarilumab 150 or 200 mg+methotrexate (n = 401 and n = 396, respectively) or placebo+methotrexate (n = 397) Q2W (MOBILITY, NCT01061736). Efficacy and patient-reported outcomes were compared between and within groups according to IL-6 tertile using linear and logistic regression.
RESULTS


In MONARCH, patients with high baseline IL-6 (n = 100; all ≥3×upper limit of normal) had higher disease activity at baseline than those with low IL-6 (n = 100). The magnitude of clinical improvement over 24 weeks with sarilumab versus adalimumab was greater in patients with high baseline IL-6 than patients with low baseline IL-6. In MOBILITY, patients with high IL-6 (n = 398) had higher disease activity and joint damage at baseline than those with low IL-6 (n = 397), were more likely to have joint progression, and had less clinical improvement over 52 weeks' treatment with placebo+methotrexate compared with sarilumab 150/200 mg+methotrexate. Baseline IL-6 and C-reactive protein were both predictive of outcomes. Safety profiles were similar between defined IL-6 tertiles.

311,32344285,"Non-thyroidal illness syndrome, the hidden player in the septic shock induced myocardial contractile depression.","Septic shock causes high mortality in hospitalized patients, especially in those that develop myocardial dysfunction as an early complication. The myocardial dysfunction of septic shock is characterized by a decrease in ventricular relaxation (diastolic dysfunction) and reduced ventricular ejection fraction (systolic dysfunction). Most patients with septic shock have low serum thyroid hormone levels, a condition known as non-thyroidal illness syndrome. Thyroid hormones sustain myocardial contractility and energy metabolism. Septic shock non-thyroidal illness syndrome causes myocardial hypothyroidism, and hypothyroidism causes myocardial dysfunction that resembles the myocardial depression of septic shock. We hypothesize that the myocardial hypothyroidism that occurs during septic shock has a causal role in the pathogenesis of septic shock-induced myocardial dysfunction. Thyroid hormones regulate the calcium cycle, the phenotype of contractile proteins, adrenergic response, and fatty acid transport and oxidation in the cardiomyocytes. Therefore, the administration of levothyroxine and liothyronine to normalize thyroid hormones level within the myocardium will improve the myocardial function. The hypothesis will be tested in humans with septic shock by performing a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study to compare the effect of thyroid hormone administration with placebo on myocardial function. The proposed hypothesis challenges the idea that non-thyroidal illness syndrome is a beneficial response of the thyroid hormone axis to illness and that thyroid hormone replacement is detrimental. The administration of thyroid hormone in order to prevent and reverse myocardial hypothyroidism during septic shock is a new theoretical concept on thyroid hormone metabolism and action at the tissue level during non-thyroidal illness syndrome. If the hypothesis is correct, clinicians should consider cardiac hypothyroidism as a central player in myocardial dysfunction caused by sepsis. Thyroid hormone replacement should be incorporated into the armamentarium of septic shock treatment.",2020,The myocardial dysfunction of septic shock is characterized by a decrease in ventricular relaxation (diastolic dysfunction) and reduced ventricular ejection fraction (systolic dysfunction).,"['hospitalized patients', 'humans with septic shock']","['Thyroid hormone replacement', 'levothyroxine and liothyronine', 'thyroid hormone', 'placebo']","['low serum thyroid hormone levels', 'ventricular relaxation (diastolic dysfunction) and reduced ventricular ejection fraction (systolic dysfunction', 'myocardial function']","[{'cui': 'C0701159', 'cui_str': 'Patient in hospital'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0086418', 'cui_str': 'Homo sapiens'}, {'cui': 'C0036983', 'cui_str': 'Septic shock'}]","[{'cui': 'C0040135', 'cui_str': 'Thyroid hormone'}, {'cui': 'C0035139', 'cui_str': 'Reimplantation'}, {'cui': 'C0040165', 'cui_str': 'levothyroxine'}, {'cui': 'C0041014', 'cui_str': 'liothyronine'}, {'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}]","[{'cui': 'C0205251', 'cui_str': 'Low'}, {'cui': 'C0229671', 'cui_str': 'Serum'}, {'cui': 'C0040135', 'cui_str': 'Thyroid hormone'}, {'cui': 'C0441889', 'cui_str': 'Levels'}, {'cui': 'C0018827', 'cui_str': 'Cardiac ventricular structure'}, {'cui': 'C0035028', 'cui_str': 'Relaxation'}, {'cui': 'C0520863', 'cui_str': 'Diastolic dysfunction'}, {'cui': 'C0392756', 'cui_str': 'Reduced'}, {'cui': 'C0042508', 'cui_str': 'Ventricular Ejection Fraction'}, {'cui': 'C0749225', 'cui_str': 'Systolic dysfunction'}, {'cui': 'C0031843', 'cui_str': 'PH'}]",,0.205492,The myocardial dysfunction of septic shock is characterized by a decrease in ventricular relaxation (diastolic dysfunction) and reduced ventricular ejection fraction (systolic dysfunction).,"[{'ForeName': 'Joaquin', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Lado-Abeal', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, Truman Medical Centers and University of Missouri Kansas City, MO, USA.

313,32344403,"Effect of Unilateral Left Nostril Breathing (Chandra Anga Pranayama) on Cognitive Function in Healthy Yoga-Naïve Individuals: A Randomized, Controlled, Pilot Study.","INTRODUCTION


Breathing modulates cortical neuronal activity. Various breathing exercises are purported to have specific effects on emotional and cognitive functions.
OBJECTIVE


To determine the effect of unilateral left nostril breathing (ULNB) on nonlateralized, overall cognitive functions using computerized psychometric tests.
METHODS


A randomized, controlled, pilot study was conducted among 20 healthy yoga-naïve medical students. ULNB was performed for 15 min by the test group (n = 10) and breath awareness by the control group (n = 10). Attention and processing speed, memory, and executive function were assessed using the Letter-Digit Substitution Test, Sternberg Memory Task, and Victoria Stroop Test, respectively. Baseline, pre- and postintervention scores were recorded.
RESULTS


There was no significant difference between the groups in baseline scores. In the Sternberg Memory Task, a statistically significant decrease in response time was seen in the test (t(9) = 3.855, p = 0.004) as well as the control group (t(9) = 3.120, p = 0.012); there was no significant difference between the groups. No significant effect of UNLB was seen in the Letter-Digit Substitution Test and Stroop Test.
CONCLUSIONS


Our study showed no difference in the effects of 15-min practice of ULNB and breath awareness on cognitive functions; both improved memory but not attention or executive function.",2020,"No significant effect of UNLB was seen in the Letter-Digit Substitution Test and Stroop Test.

The study was randomized, cross-over, single-blind and placebo-controlled. Rifampin 600 mg or placebo once daily was administered for a week and the 24hr ambulatory BP was monitored at the end of each arm on the eighth day. Rifampin elevated the mean systolic and diastolic 24hr BP (4.7 mmHg, P < 0.0001, and 3.0 mmHg, P < 0.001, respectively) as well as the mean heart rate (3.5 bpm, P = 0.038). The serum renin concentration and the plasma renin activity were increased. Although rifampin increased circulating 4β-hydroxycholesterol (4βHC) as expected, the plasma 4βHC concentration strongly negatively correlated with 24hr BP, especially systolic, in both rifampin and placebo arms (rifampin systolic BP, r = -0.69, P < 0.001; placebo systolic BP, r = -0.70, P < 0.001). The 4βHC, an agonist for liver X receptor (LXR), induced renin expression modestly in LXR-α expressing Calu-6 cells but only at unphysiologically high 4βHC concentrations. In conclusion, rifampin stimulates renin activity and has a hypertensive effect. This finding should be considered when designing interaction studies involving rifampin or other PXR agonists.

315,32345329,Peer support during in vivo exposure homework to reverse attrition from prolonged exposure therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD): description of a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND


Effective treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (e.g., prolonged exposure (PE); cognitive processing therapy (CPT)) exist and are widely adopted by the Departments of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Defense (DoD). Unfortunately, dropout from these treatments regularly exceeds 30%. However, in a recent survey of patients who dropped out of PE, approximately half indicated a greater likelihood of completion if a peer who had completed treatment were available to help with the in vivo exposure homework.
METHODS


We will use a between-groups randomized controlled design with repeated assessment at baseline, post treatment, and 3- and 6-month follow-up across measures of PTSD, depression, and functioning with 150 veterans who have indicated that they intend to drop out of treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two PE + Peer Support conditions: (1) a peer will offer support directly during in vivo exposure homework for 3-4 weeks; vs (2) a peer will call weekly for 3-4 weeks to offer general support and to check in on treatment progress.
DISCUSSION


The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that dropout from exposure-based PTSD treatment may be mitigated by using peers as support agents directly during PE in vivo homework experiences. Specifically, we intend to determine: whether patients who have dropped out of PE and are offered the ""in vivo peer"" adjunctive component to PE therapy will (1) return and complete treatment and (2) evince reduced PTSD symptomatology, compared to the same PE treatment, but with general peer support more reflective of current VA practices.

316,32345344,The MiLES intervention targeting employers to promote successful return to work of employees with cancer: design of a pilot randomised controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND


Employers express a need for support to facilitate the return to work (RTW) process of employees with cancer. We have developed the MiLES intervention, an online toolbox targeting employers during the RTW of employees with cancer. To evaluate the MiLES intervention, we propose the design of a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT). The aim of this pilot is to determine whether a future RCT to study the effectiveness of this intervention on successful RTW of employees with cancer is feasible. Secondary aims are to obtain preliminary results on the effectiveness of the intervention and to determine the sample size needed in a future definitive RCT.
METHODS


A pilot RCT with a 6-month follow-up will be conducted. Using medical specialists at Dutch hospitals, we aim to enrol 90 participants diagnosed with cancer (<2 years earlier) aged 18-63 years who are in paid employment with an employer and who are currently sick-listed or partly sick-listed for <1 year. Participants randomised to the intervention group will be asked to inform their employer about the online toolbox supporting employers during the RTW process of employees with cancer. Participants in the control group will receive 'care as usual' from their employer. All measures will be assessed at the level of the employee using questionnaires at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of follow-up. The feasibility of a future RCT will be determined using criteria concerning method-related uncertainties and acceptability of the study protocol. The primary effect measure will be successful RTW (that is, RTW perceived as being successful by the cancer survivor themselves). This effect measure will be used to perform the sample size calculation for a future definitive RCT.
DISCUSSION


The design is proposed to determine the feasibility to study the effectiveness of the MiLES intervention targeting employers on the successful RTW of employees diagnosed with cancer. This pilot RCT can increase the probability of a successful future definitive RCT on the effectiveness of the intervention and potentially obviate the need to carry out an unfeasible and resource-intensive study.

317,32345348,Intense versus standard regimens of intermittent occlusion therapy for unilateral moderate amblyopia in children: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND


We reported that in our previous study that wearing intermittent occlusion therapy glasses (IO-therapy) for 4 hours (h) was non-inferior to patching for 2 h in 3 to 8-year-old children with amblyopia. We hypothesize that an intense regimen of 12-h IO-therapy per day for 4 weeks could be as effective as the standard regimen of 4-h IO-therapy per day for 12 weeks in treating moderate amblyopia in 3 to 8-year-old children.
METHODS/DESIGN


A total of 56 children between 3 and 8 years of age with amblyopia in association with anisometropia and/or strabismus will be enrolled. All participants will be prescribed IO-therapy glasses (Amblyz™), set at 30-s opaque/transparent intervals (i.e., occluded 50% of wear time). They will be randomized to receive the standard regimen for 12 weeks or the intense regimen for 4 weeks. Adherence to using the IO-therapy glasses will be objectively monitored in each participant by means of a microsensor dose monitor. The primary study objective is to compare the effectiveness of an intense regimen to a standard regimen of IO-therapy in 3 to 8-year-old children with moderate amblyopia. The secondary study objectives are to determine whether adherence differs between an intense regimen and a standard regimen of IO-therapy, and to determine the dose-response relationship of IO-therapy.
DISCUSSION


In addition to testing the effectiveness, this study will test for the first time the association between treatment adherence and the visual outcome of IO-therapy, which will enhance our understanding of the dose-response relationship of IO-therapy. If an intense regimen is shown to be effective, it would alter amblyopia treatment strategies and improve visual outcomes.

318,32345352,"Lay-therapist-delivered, low-intensity, psychosocial intervention for refugees and asylum seekers (PROSPER): protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial.","BACKGROUND


Asylum seekers and refugees (AS&Rs) experience impaired mental health and wellbeing, related to stresses in their country of origin, experiences in transit and reception on arrival, including significant barriers to accessing mainstream services. Their contact with health care is often crisis-driven and mediated through non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Problem Management Plus (PM+) is a psychosocial intervention recommended by the World Health Organisation to address distress experienced by adults affected by humanitarian crises. We are investigating its application for the first time in a high-income country.
METHODS


In a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT), PM+ will be delivered to AS&Rs in contact with NGOs in Liverpool City Region, UK by lay therapists who have lived experience of forced migration. Following systematic review and stakeholder engagement, PM+ has been adapted to the local context, and lay therapists have been trained in its delivery. We will assess the feasibility of conducting a three-arm RCT of five 90-min sessions of PM+, delivered individually or in groups by lay therapists to AS&Rs experiencing emotional distress and functional impairment, compared with each other and with usual support offered by local NGOs. Distress and impairment at baseline will be measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO-DAS). We aim to recruit 105 participants, 35 per arm. Primary health outcomes are anxiety and depressive symptoms at 3 months, measured by HADS. Secondary outcomes include subjective wellbeing, functional status, progress on identified problems, presence of post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive disorder and service usage. Longer-term impact will be assessed at 6 months post baseline, on the same parameters. We will assess the feasibility of conducting a full RCT in relation to the following elements: recruitment and retention of lay therapists and study participants; fidelity of delivery of PM+; and suitability of the study measures, including any linguistic or cultural barriers.
DISCUSSION


We will use these findings to specify the parameters for a full RCT to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PM+ in reducing emotional distress and health inequalities, and improving functional ability and wellbeing, amongst asylum seekers and refugees.

The purpose of this study was to identify the effects that problematic cell phone use and nomophobia have on learning in nursing students. A quasi-experimental study was carried out among nursing students, with a control group (n = 61, 49.2%) and an experimental group (n = 63, 50.8%). The experimental group left their cell phones, in sound or vibration mode, as they normally kept them, on a table located in the corner of the classroom. Both groups showed higher-than-average levels of nomophobia at the beginning of the class. As for problematic cell phone use and attention, it was found that there were statistically significant differences in both cases (U = 1355.500, Z = -2.830, P = .005; U = 1449.000, Z = -2.363, P = .018, respectively), and the experimental group had higher average scores, as well as in those related to knowledge. A relationship has been found between nomophobia and problematic cell phone use.

320,32349059,Two Doses of Tranexamic Acid Reduce Blood Loss in Primary Posterior Lumbar Fusion Surgery: A Randomized-controlled Trial.,"PURPOSE


Tranexamic acid (TXA) has been widely used in hip and knee arthroplasty to reduce perioperative blood loss and blood transfusion, but the dosage and efficacy of TXA in posterior lumbar spinal surgery are not fully clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of TXA and to determine whether 2 doses of TXA could reduce the blood loss in primary single-segment or double-segment posterior lumbar fusion surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS


A total of 150 patients with lumbar degenerative disease undergoing posterior lumbar interbody fusion surgery between October 2017 and February 2019 were randomized to 3 groups. Group A was treated with 0.9% normal saline solution without TXA, group B was treated with a 15 mg/kg loading dose intravenous infusion 30 minutes before surgery, and group C was treated with a 15 mg/kg loading dose intravenous infusion 30 minutes before surgery; then, the same dose was administered again 3 hours later. The assessed outcomes were the operation time, the total blood loss, the hidden blood loss, postoperative drainage, blood transfusions, incidence of venous thromboembolism, and incision infection.
RESULTS


The total blood loss, the hidden blood loss, and postoperative drainage were the lowest in group C. The amount of intraoperative blood loss was similar among the 3 groups. The hemoglobin and hematocrit values of the third postoperative day were the highest in group C. No significant differences in the incidence of complications and adverse events from TXA use were observed among the 3 groups.

321,32349117,One-day tropisetron treatment improves cognitive deficits and P50 inhibition deficits in schizophrenia.,"The core features of schizophrenia (SCZ) include cognitive deficits and impaired sensory gating represented by P50 inhibition deficits, which appear to be related to the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). An agonist of nAChR receptor may improve these defects. This study aimed to investigate how administering multiple doses of tropisetron, a partial agonist of nAChR, for 1 day would affect cognitive deficits and P50 inhibition deficits in SCZ patients. We randomized 40 SCZ non-smokers into a double-blind clinical trial with four groups: placebo, 5 mg/d, 10 mg/d, and 20 mg/d of oral tropisetron. Their P50 ratios were all more than 0.5 and they took risperidone at 3-6 mg/day for at least a month before participating in the experiment. We measured the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) and P50 inhibition before and one day after treatment. After one day of treatment, the total RBANS scores of the 20 mg and 5 mg tropisetron groups, and the immediate memory of the 10 mg group were significantly higher than placebo group. The P50 ratio was smaller in the 5 mg and 10 mg groups than in the placebo group (both p < 0.05) after treatment. Furthermore, the improvement in RBANS total score was correlated with increased S1 latency (p < 0.05), and the increase in immediate memory score was correlated with decreased S2 amplitude. One day of treatment with tropisetron improved both cognitive and P50 inhibition deficits, suggesting that longer term treatment with α7 nAChR agonists for these deficits in SCZ may be promising.",2020,"Furthermore, the improvement in RBANS total score was correlated with increased S1 latency (p < 0.05), and the increase in immediate memory score was correlated with decreased S2 amplitude.","['schizophrenia', 'SCZ patients']","['tropisetron', 'risperidone', 'oral tropisetron', 'placebo']","['S1 latency', 'P50 ratio', 'total RBANS scores', 'cognitive and P50 inhibition deficits', 'immediate memory score', 'P50 ratios', 'Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) and P50 inhibition', 'cognitive deficits and P50 inhibition deficits', 'RBANS total score']","[{'cui': 'C0036341', 'cui_str': 'Schizophrenia'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}]","[{'cui': 'C0063322', 'cui_str': 'tropisetron'}, {'cui': 'C0073393', 'cui_str': 'Risperidone'}, {'cui': 'C0226896', 'cui_str': 'Oral cavity structure'}, {'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}]","[{'cui': 'C0242465', 'cui_str': 'Response Latency'}, {'cui': 'C0219874', 'cui_str': 'p50(csk)'}, {'cui': 'C0456603', 'cui_str': 'Ratio'}, {'cui': 'C0439810', 'cui_str': 'Total'}, {'cui': 'C2959617', 'cui_str': 'Repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status score'}, {'cui': 'C0021467', 'cui_str': 'Psychological Inhibition'}, {'cui': 'C0025265', 'cui_str': 'Immediate memory'}, {'cui': 'C0449820', 'cui_str': 'Score'}, {'cui': 'C0449438', 'cui_str': 'Status'}, {'cui': 'C4505412', 'cui_str': 'Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status'}, {'cui': 'C0009241', 'cui_str': 'Cognitive disorder'}]",40.0,0.0632082,"Furthermore, the improvement in RBANS total score was correlated with increased S1 latency (p < 0.05), and the increase in immediate memory score was correlated with decreased S2 amplitude.","[{'ForeName': 'Luyao', 'Initials': 'L', 'LastName': 'Xia', 'Affiliation': 'Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Lei', 'Initials': 'L', 'LastName': 'Liu', 'Affiliation': 'Mental Health Center, Shantou University, Shantou, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Xiaohong', 'Initials': 'X', 'LastName': 'Hong', 'Affiliation': 'Mental Health Center, Shantou University, Shantou, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Dongmei', 'Initials': 'D', 'LastName': 'Wang', 'Affiliation': 'Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Gaoxia', 'Initials': 'G', 'LastName': 'Wei', 'Affiliation': 'Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jiesi', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Wang', 'Affiliation': 'Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Huixia', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Zhou', 'Affiliation': 'Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Hang', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Xu', 'Affiliation': 'Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Yang', 'Initials': 'Y', 'LastName': 'Tian', 'Affiliation': 'Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Qilong', 'Initials': 'Q', 'LastName': 'Dai', 'Affiliation': 'Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Hanjing E', 'Initials': 'HE', 'LastName': 'Wu', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Catherine', 'Initials': 'C', 'LastName': 'Chang', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Li', 'Initials': 'L', 'LastName': 'Wang', 'Affiliation': 'Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Thomas R', 'Initials': 'TR', 'LastName': 'Kosten', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Xiang Yang', 'Initials': 'XY', 'LastName': 'Zhang', 'Affiliation': 'Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China. zhangxy@psych.ac.cn.'}]",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,['10.1038/s41386-020-0685-0']
322,32349134,[Hydrogen sulphide stimuli shorten exhalation during sleep as well as in wakefulness].,"BACKGROUND


In the attentive waking state, pleasant odours often prolong inhalation while unpleasant odours often shorten the exhalation. It should be checked whether this induced breathing pattern is maintained even during sleep.
METHODOLOGY


23 healthy normosmic adults were examined by polysomnography for one night and randomized pulsed either with H 2 S, phenylethyl alcohol (PEA) or CO 2  via a flow olfactometer. The determination of the sleep stages was based on the standard polysomnography curves. From the breathing curves (respiratory nasal pressure breathing, thoracic or abdominal belt breathing) a low-artefact curve was selected and seven breaths were measured from their breathing signal around the trigger impulse. The duration of inspiration (DIN) and the duration of the expiration (DEX) were determined from the six prestimulatory breaths and from breath with the stimulus onset and thus defined a reaction index (RI) indicating whether there is a significant change in shortening or prolonging DIN and/or DEX. These different RI were corrected by the spontaneous baseline RI and analysed according to the type of stimulus and the sleep stages.
RESULTS


Reaction indices with reductions of DEX were larger than spontaneous RI and RI for PEA and H 2 S stimulation. In the case of CO 2  irritation, RI with reductions of DIN and DEX were larger than with olfactory stimulation. All RI were equal in their amount between sleep stages. In REM, the difference between olfactory RI with shortened DEX between H 2 S and PEA stimulation was greatest.
CONCLUSION


When stimulated with an unpleasant smell in sleep, the respiratory reaction pattern from the awake state is preserved. RI with shortened DEX can be considered as an imperfect arousal.",2020,"In the case of CO 2  irritation, RI with reductions of DIN and DEX were larger than with olfactory stimulation.",['23 healthy normosmic adults'],"['DEX', 'RI with shortened DEX', 'polysomnography for one night and randomized pulsed either with H 2 S, phenylethyl alcohol (PEA) or CO 2  via a flow olfactometer', 'Hydrogen sulphide stimuli shorten exhalation']","['duration of inspiration (DIN) and the duration of the expiration (DEX', 'breathing curves (respiratory nasal pressure breathing, thoracic or abdominal belt breathing']","[{'cui': 'C0001675', 'cui_str': 'Adult'}]","[{'cui': 'C0011816', 'cui_str': 'Dextromethorphan'}, {'cui': 'C0441636', 'cui_str': 'Surgical shortening - action'}, {'cui': 'C0162701', 'cui_str': 'Polysomnography'}, {'cui': 'C0240526', 'cui_str': 'Night time'}, {'cui': 'C0034107', 'cui_str': 'Pulse taking'}, {'cui': 'C0011744', 'cui_str': 'Deuterium'}, {'cui': 'C0031398', 'cui_str': 'Phenylethyl Alcohol'}, {'cui': 'C0020282', 'cui_str': 'Hydrogen sulfide'}, {'cui': 'C0234402', 'cui_str': 'Stimulus'}, {'cui': 'C0231800', 'cui_str': 'Expiration'}]","[{'cui': 'C0449238', 'cui_str': 'Duration'}, {'cui': 'C0004048', 'cui_str': 'Inhaling'}, {'cui': 'C0231800', 'cui_str': 'Expiration'}, {'cui': 'C0011816', 'cui_str': 'Dextromethorphan'}, {'cui': 'C0205134', 'cui_str': 'Curved'}, {'cui': 'C0429206', 'cui_str': 'Nasal pressure'}, {'cui': 'C0729233', 'cui_str': 'Dissecting aortic aneurysm, thoracic'}, {'cui': 'C0000726', 'cui_str': 'Abdominal'}, {'cui': 'C0452227', 'cui_str': 'Belt'}]",23.0,0.0153785,"In the case of CO 2  irritation, RI with reductions of DIN and DEX were larger than with olfactory stimulation.","[{'ForeName': 'Hilmar', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Gudziol', 'Affiliation': 'Klinik für Hals-, Nasen- und Ohrenkrankheiten, Jena\xa0University Hospital, Jena, Germany.'}, {'ForeName': 'Tina', 'Initials': 'T', 'LastName': 'Quaas', 'Affiliation': 'Klinik für Hals-, Nasen- und Ohrenkrankheiten, Jena\xa0University Hospital, Jena, Germany.'}, {'ForeName': 'Orlando', 'Initials': 'O', 'LastName': 'Guntinas-Lichius', 'Affiliation': 'Klinik für Hals-, Nasen- und Ohrenkrankheiten, Jena\xa0University Hospital, Jena, Germany.'}, {'ForeName': 'Holger', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Lehnich', 'Affiliation': 'Medizinische Fakultät ZMG, Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany.'}, {'ForeName': 'Thomas', 'Initials': 'T', 'LastName': 'Bitter', 'Affiliation': 'Klinik für Hals-, Nasen- und Ohrenheilkunde, Jena\xa0University Hospital, Jena, Germany.'}]",Laryngo- rhino- otologie,['10.1055/a-1157-9314']
323,32349193,Effects of canagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure: a randomized trial (CANDLE).,"AIMS


Little is known about the impact of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on cardiac biomarkers, such as natriuretic peptides, in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients with concomitant chronic heart failure (CHF). We compared the effect of canagliflozin with glimepiride, based on changes in N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), in that patient population.
METHODS AND RESULTS


Patients with T2D and stable CHF, randomized to receive canagliflozin 100 mg or glimepiride (starting-dose: 0.5 mg), were examined using the primary endpoint of non-inferiority of canagliflozin vs. glimepiride, defined as a margin of 1.1 in the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the group ratio of percentage change in NT-proBNP at 24 weeks. Data analysis of 233 patients showed mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at randomization was 57.6 ± 14.6%, with 71% of patients having a preserved LVEF (≥50%). Ratio of NT-proBNP percentage change was 0.48 (95% CI, -0.13 to 1.59, P = 0.226) and therefore did not meet the prespecified non-inferiority margin. However, NT-proBNP levels did show a non-significant trend lower in the canagliflozin group [adjusted group difference; -74.7 pg/mL (95% CI, -159.3 to 10.9), P = 0.087] and also in the subgroup with preserved LVEF [-58.3 (95% CI, -127.6 to 11.0, P = 0.098]).
CONCLUSIONS


This study did not meet the predefined primary endpoint of changes in NT-proBNP levels, with 24 weeks of treatment with canagliflozin vs. glimepiride. Further research is warranted to determine whether patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, regardless of diabetes status, could potentially benefit from treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors.",2020,Ratio of NT-proBNP percentage change was 0.48,"['type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients with concomitant chronic heart failure (CHF', 'Patients with T2D and stable CHF', 'patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, regardless of diabetes status', 'patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic heart failure']","['canagliflozin', 'canagliflozin 100\xa0mg or glimepiride', 'canagliflozin vs. glimepiride', 'canagliflozin with glimepiride', 'sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors']","['NT-proBNP levels', 'Ratio of NT-proBNP percentage change', 'mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF']","[{'cui': 'C0441730', 'cui_str': 'Type 2'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0521115', 'cui_str': 'Simultaneous'}, {'cui': 'C0018802', 'cui_str': 'Congestive heart failure'}, {'cui': 'C0332307', 'cui_str': 'Type - attribute'}, {'cui': 'C0205360', 'cui_str': 'Stable'}, {'cui': 'C2960127', 'cui_str': 'Heart failure with normal ejection fraction'}, {'cui': 'C0011849', 'cui_str': 'Diabetes mellitus'}, {'cui': 'C0449438', 'cui_str': 'Status'}]","[{'cui': 'C2974540', 'cui_str': 'canagliflozin'}, {'cui': 'C3556569', 'cui_str': 'canagliflozin 100 MG [Invokana]'}, {'cui': 'C0061323', 'cui_str': 'glimepiride'}, {'cui': 'C0037473', 'cui_str': 'Sodium'}, {'cui': 'C0017725', 'cui_str': 'Glucose'}, {'cui': 'C0598849', 'cui_str': 'Co-Transporters'}, {'cui': 'C0243077', 'cui_str': 'inhibitors'}]","[{'cui': 'C1533071', 'cui_str': 'N terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level'}, {'cui': 'C0456603', 'cui_str': 'Ratio'}, {'cui': 'C0205088', 'cui_str': 'End-stage'}, {'cui': 'C0754710', 'cui_str': 'Pro-brain natriuretic peptide'}, {'cui': 'C0439165', 'cui_str': 'Percent'}, {'cui': 'C0037400', 'cui_str': 'Social Change'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0428772', 'cui_str': 'Left ventricular ejection fraction'}, {'cui': 'C0205091', 'cui_str': 'Left'}, {'cui': 'C0042508', 'cui_str': 'Ventricular Ejection Fraction'}]",233.0,0.223378,Ratio of NT-proBNP percentage change was 0.48,"[{'ForeName': 'Atsushi', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Tanaka', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Itaru', 'Initials': 'I', 'LastName': 'Hisauchi', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, Dokkyo Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Koshigaya, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Isao', 'Initials': 'I', 'LastName': 'Taguchi', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, Dokkyo Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Koshigaya, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Akira', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Sezai', 'Affiliation': 'The Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Shigeru', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Toyoda', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Dokkyo Medical University School of Medicine, Mibu, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Hirofumi', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Tomiyama', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Masataka', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Sata', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Tokushima University Graduate School, Tokushima, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Shinichiro', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Ueda', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jun-Ichi', 'Initials': 'JI', 'LastName': 'Oyama', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Masafumi', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Kitakaze', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Medicine and Development, National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center, Suita, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Toyoaki', 'Initials': 'T', 'LastName': 'Murohara', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Koichi', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Node', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': '', 'Initials': '', 'LastName': '', 'Affiliation': ''}]",ESC heart failure,['10.1002/ehf2.12707']
324,32349692,Online cognitive behavioral therapy enhanced for binge eating disorder: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND


Binge eating disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating accompanied by a sense of lack of control. Of the different treatments available, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Enhanced and guided self-help treatment are recommended. As online treatment offers several additional advantages, we have developed a CBT-Enhanced online guided self-help intervention. The aim of this study is to determine whether this intervention reduces eating disorder pathology and increases the amount of binge free days in adults classified with binge eating disorder or other specified feeding or eating disorder- binge eating disorder, compared to an untreated waiting list condition. The experimental condition is hypothesized to be superior to the waiting list condition.
METHODS


The efficacy of an online guided self-help intervention for binge eating disorder will be assessed by conducting a randomized controlled trial. The trial will target adult individuals classified with binge eating disorder or other specified feeding or eating disorder- binge eating disorder with a body mass index between 19.5 and 40, referred to an eating disorder treatment center. Dual arm allotment will be performed in a 1:1 ratio stratified for BMI above or below 30. Randomization will be blinded to the online intervention (n = 90), or to the control waiting list condition (n = 90). Assessors will be blinded and assessments will be administered at baseline, week 5, at end-of-treatment, and at 12 and 24 weeks follow-up. Primary outcome will be eating disorder pathology, operationalized as number of days on which binge eating occurred between the two conditions during the period of the intervention. Secondary outcome measures will be differences in other eating disorder pathology, clinical impairment and in quality of life, while therapeutic alliance, demographic characteristics and followed treatment module will serve as effect moderators. Several types of costs will be assessed.
DISCUSSION

325,32349693,SIP SMART: a parallel group randomised feasibility trial of a tailored pre-treatment swallowing intervention package compared with usual care for patients with head and neck cancer.,"BACKGROUND


Dysphagia or difficulty in swallowing affects quality of life for most patients with head and neck cancer. SIP SMART - [Swallowing Intervention Package: Self-Monitoring, Assessment, Rehabilitation Training] aims to improve post-treatment swallowing outcomes through a targeted and tailored pre-treatment intervention. This feasibility study assessed 1) recruitment and retention, 2) patient acceptability of randomisation and participation, 3) patient adherence, and 4) sought to identify a suitable primary outcome for a definitive trial, including sample size estimation.
METHODS


This two-arm parallel group non-blinded randomised feasibility trial took place within a head and neck centre at a teaching hospital in London, UK. Patients newly diagnosed with stage III/IV head and neck cancer were recruited and underwent 6-month follow-up. Patients were randomised to SIP-SMART or usual care via an online web-based system. SIP SMART comprised two 45-min consultations including a baseline clinical and instrumental swallowing assessment, relevant educational information, targeted swallowing exercises, and specific behaviour change strategies to increase exercise adherence. Usual care comprised a single session including a baseline clinical assessment and generic information about the likely impact of treatment on swallowing.
RESULTS


A total of 106 patients were identified at pre-screening, 70 were assessed for eligibility. Twenty-six patients did not meet eligibility criteria [0.37, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.49]. Five of 44 [0.11, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.24] eligible patients were not approached by researchers during clinic. Seven [0.18, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.33] of the 39 approached declined participation. Target recruitment (32 consented patients) was achieved within the timeframe. At 6-months 29/32 [0.91, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.97] patients remained in the trial. Acceptability of randomisation and participation in the intervention was favourable, and adherence to the exercises exceeded the pre-defined 35% minimum criterion. The MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory swallow related quality of life measure was selected as the most suitable primary outcome for sample size estimation. No adverse effects arose from the intervention, or study participation.
CONCLUSIONS


A definitive trial of the SIP SMART intervention compared to usual care is feasible and can be undertaken with patients with head and neck cancer treated within the NHS.

326,32349698,Mindfulness-based crisis interventions (MBCI) for psychosis within acute inpatient psychiatric settings; a feasibility randomised controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND


Inpatient psychiatric care is a scarce and expensive resource in the National Health Service (NHS), with chronic bed shortages being partly driven by high re-admission rates. Brief inpatient talking therapies for psychosis could help reduce re-admission rates. The primary aim was to assess feasibility and acceptability of a novel, brief, mindfulness-based intervention for inpatients with psychosis. The secondary aim was to collect pilot outcome data on readmission rate, at 6 and 12 months (m) post discharge, and self-report symptom measures at 6 m.
METHODS


The amBITION study (BrIef Talking therapIes ON wards) was a parallel group, feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT). In addition to treatment as usual (TAU), eligible inpatients with psychotic symptoms were randomly allocated to receive either (Mindfulness-Based Crisis Intervention; MBCI) or a control intervention (Social Activity Therapy; SAT), for 1-5 sessions.
RESULTS


Fifty participants were recruited (26 MBCI; 24 SAT); all received at least 1 therapy session (mean = 3). Follow-up rates were 98% at 6 m and 96% at 12 m for service use data extracted from clinical notes, and 86% for self-report measures. At 6 m follow-up, re-admission rates were similar across groups (MBCI = 6, SAT = 5; odds ratio = 1.20, 95% CI: 0.312-4.61). At 12 m follow-up, re-admissions were lower in the MBCI group (MBCI = 7, SAT = 11; odds ratio = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.14-1.51). Three participants experienced adverse events; none was related to trial participation.
CONCLUSIONS


Delivering a brief mindfulness-based inpatient intervention for psychosis is feasible and acceptable, and may reduce risk of short-term readmission. These promising findings warrant progression to a larger clinical effectiveness trial.

327,32349711,Does ligation of the dorsal branch of the cephalic vein affect the patency of a distal forearm arteriovenous fistula? A randomised study.,"BACKGROUND


Whether ligation of the dorsal branch of the cephalic vein during the surgical establishment of the radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (RCAVF) favorably or adversely affects the patency rate of the RCAVF remains controversial. We performed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of dorsal branch ligation on the patency rate of RCAVF.
METHODS


A total of 115 patients who underwent surgical establishment were randomized to two groups treated with or without ligation of the dorsal branch of the cephalic vein during the surgical process. The primary patency rates of the RCAVF at 90, 270, and 360 days after the surgery and the secondary patency rates during a follow-up up to 1 year were compared.
RESULTS


The patency rate did not differ significantly between the two groups at 3, 9, or 12 months after the procedure (P > 0.05). The combined primary patency rates of the RCAVF in patients from both groups at 3, 9 and 12 months after the procedure were 87.6, 82, and 74.5% respectively, while the combined secondary patency rate was 92.2% at the 1-year follow-up. The Log-rank test indicated that the initial patency rate and secondary patency rate did not differ significantly between the two groups (P = 0.674 and 0.759, respectively).
CONCLUSION


This clinical study indicated that ligation of the dorsal branch of the cephalic vein does not significantly affect the patency of the arteriovenous fistula with a 1-year follow-up.

329,32343623,Capturing the perspectives of women with coronary artery disease regarding interval training or continuous exercise in cardiac rehabilitation.,"Background:  Motivators and barriers to exercise participation in women with coronary artery disease remain poorly understood. With evidence suggesting that women with coronary artery disease are less likely to adhere to exercise during cardiac rehabilitation and are more likely to drop out, it is important to understand these factors in order to optimize cardiac rehabilitation programs for women. Methods:  We contribute to the discussion by presenting findings from a qualitative study using two focus groups with nine women with coronary artery disease sharing their experiences with attending cardiac rehabilitation and exercising in this setting, in addition to their perceived motivators and barriers to performing aerobic interval training. Focus group transcripts were analysed using a deductive thematic approach with Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory as the guiding conceptual framework. Results:  Four themes were identified regarding the attitudes and experiences of attending and exercising at cardiac rehabilitation, while five themes capturing the motivators and barriers for these women to perform aerobic interval training were identified for the first time. These novel themes encompassed the daunting nature of it, the physical discomfort associated with it, and conversely, the potential sense of enjoyment and accomplishment that it could bring. Conclusion:  This study demonstrates the complexity of implementation of aerobic interval training into clinical practice, and suggests that further research is warranted to explore this domain.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONDespite challenges in feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial in female patients with coronary artery disease examining the effects of aerobic interval training versus moderate-intensity continuous exercise on aerobic exercise capacity, there was a significant per protocol treatment effect of 0.95 ml·kg -1 ·min -1  in favour of aerobic interval training.The cardiac rehabilitation environment provides key facilitators and perceived benefits for exercising and attending cardiac rehabilitation for women, and thus emphasises the need for improving referral and enrolment processes specifically for women into cardiac rehabilitation programs.Aerobic interval training may elicit feelings of fear and physical discomfort, or may be precluded by comorbid conditions, therefore, judicious consideration must be taken in examining the suitability of implementation into clinical practice for each female patient.",2020,"The cardiac rehabilitation environment provides key facilitators and perceived benefits for exercising and attending cardiac rehabilitation for women, and thus emphasises the need for improving referral and enrolment processes specifically for women into cardiac rehabilitation programs.","['nine women with coronary artery disease sharing their experiences with attending cardiac rehabilitation and exercising in this setting, in addition to their perceived motivators and barriers to performing aerobic interval training', 'female patients with coronary artery disease', 'women with coronary artery disease remain poorly understood', 'women with coronary artery disease regarding interval training or continuous exercise in cardiac rehabilitation', 'women with coronary artery disease']","['aerobic interval training', 'Aerobic interval training', 'aerobic interval training versus moderate-intensity continuous exercise']",['aerobic exercise capacity'],"[{'cui': 'C0043210', 'cui_str': 'Woman'}, {'cui': 'C0010054', 'cui_str': 'Coronary arteriosclerosis'}, {'cui': 'C0332287', 'cui_str': 'With'}, {'cui': 'C0150497', 'cui_str': 'Cardiac rehabilitation'}, {'cui': 'C0002838', 'cui_str': 'Andorra'}, {'cui': 'C0173022', 'cui_str': 'Barrier (varnish)'}, {'cui': 'C0884358', 'cui_str': 'Performed'}, {'cui': 'C1272706', 'cui_str': 'Interval'}, {'cui': 'C0040607', 'cui_str': 'Training Programs'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0205169', 'cui_str': 'Bad'}, {'cui': 'C0162340', 'cui_str': 'Understanding'}, {'cui': 'C0549178', 'cui_str': 'Continuous'}, {'cui': 'C0015259', 'cui_str': 'Exercise'}]","[{'cui': 'C1272706', 'cui_str': 'Interval'}, {'cui': 'C0040607', 'cui_str': 'Training Programs'}, {'cui': 'C4081855', 'cui_str': 'Moderate intensity'}, {'cui': 'C0549178', 'cui_str': 'Continuous'}, {'cui': 'C0015259', 'cui_str': 'Exercise'}]","[{'cui': 'C0001701', 'cui_str': 'Aerobic exercises'}]",9.0,0.0287844,"The cardiac rehabilitation environment provides key facilitators and perceived benefits for exercising and attending cardiac rehabilitation for women, and thus emphasises the need for improving referral and enrolment processes specifically for women into cardiac rehabilitation programs.","[{'ForeName': 'Leanna S', 'Initials': 'LS', 'LastName': 'Lee', 'Affiliation': 'Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.'}, {'ForeName': 'Laura', 'Initials': 'L', 'LastName': 'Banks', 'Affiliation': 'Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation Program, University Health Network/Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, Toronto, Canada.'}, {'ForeName': 'Paul I', 'Initials': 'PI', 'LastName': 'Oh', 'Affiliation': 'Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation Program, University Health Network/Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, Toronto, Canada.'}, {'ForeName': 'Dina', 'Initials': 'D', 'LastName': 'Brooks', 'Affiliation': 'Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.'}, {'ForeName': 'Tracey J F', 'Initials': 'TJF', 'LastName': 'Colella', 'Affiliation': 'Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation Program, University Health Network/Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, Toronto, Canada.'}]",Disability and rehabilitation,['10.1080/09638288.2020.1756469']
330,32343625,Executive function moderates naltrexone effects on methamphetamine-induced craving and subjective responses.,"Background : Emerging evidence suggests that opioid receptor antagonists, such as naltrexone, are effective pharmacotherapies for alcohol, opioid, and possibly stimulant use disorders. It is posited that naltrexone exerts its effects, in part, by increasing functional connectivity between neural reward circuitry and frontal systems implicated in executive function. Yet no studies had examined whether executive function moderates these effects. Objectives : This study examined whether a composite measure of executive function (EF) moderates the effect of naltrexone on craving for methamphetamine and subjective responses following infusion of the drug. Methods : Individuals with methamphetamine use disorder (N = 30; 27% female) completed baseline neurocognitive assessments of premorbid and executive function, and an executive function factor was computed. Participants then underwent a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study of titration with naltrexone and placebo. Participants then received a 30-mg intravenous methamphetamine infusion and completed subjective response questionnaires at 8 times in the 120 minutes post-infusion. Results : Multilevel mixed models indicated a significant EF × medication interaction, reflecting greater effects of naltrexone to decrease ""desire to access the drug"", ""want more of the drug"", ""crave the drug"", ""feel drug effects"" and ""feel high"" in participants with low EF compared to those with high EF (Bs = .36-1.29, SEs = .14-.17,  ps <0.01). These effects remained significant after controlling for premorbid cognitive functioning, baseline responses to methamphetamine, severity of methamphetamine use, and methamphetamine-related functional problems. Conclusion : Naltrexone may be especially effective in methamphetamine-dependent individuals with low EF. Neuropsychological assessments may also provide predictive clinical utility not captured by traditional measures of substance use severity.",2020,"These effects remained significant after controlling for premorbid cognitive functioning, baseline responses to methamphetamine, severity of methamphetamine use, and methamphetamine-related functional problems.","['methamphetamine-dependent individuals with low EF', 'Methods : Individuals with methamphetamine use disorder (N = 30; 27% female']","['30-mg intravenous methamphetamine infusion', ' ', 'naltrexone', 'Naltrexone', 'naltrexone and placebo']",['methamphetamine-induced craving and subjective responses'],"[{'cui': 'C0025611', 'cui_str': 'Methamphetamine'}, {'cui': 'C0429964', 'cui_str': 'Dependent for dressing'}, {'cui': 'C0027361', 'cui_str': 'Person'}, {'cui': 'C0205251', 'cui_str': 'Low'}, {'cui': 'C0935584', 'cui_str': 'Executive Control'}, {'cui': 'C0025663', 'cui_str': 'Method'}, {'cui': 'C0042153', 'cui_str': 'utilization'}, {'cui': 'C0012634', 'cui_str': 'Disease'}, {'cui': 'C0043210', 'cui_str': 'Woman'}]","[{'cui': 'C0348016', 'cui_str': 'Intravenous'}, {'cui': 'C0025611', 'cui_str': 'Methamphetamine'}, {'cui': 'C0574032', 'cui_str': 'Infusion'}, {'cui': 'C0027360', 'cui_str': 'Naltrexone'}, {'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}]","[{'cui': 'C0025611', 'cui_str': 'Methamphetamine'}, {'cui': 'C0205263', 'cui_str': 'Induced'}, {'cui': 'C0870371', 'cui_str': 'Craving'}, {'cui': 'C0439655', 'cui_str': 'Subjective'}]",,0.14062,"These effects remained significant after controlling for premorbid cognitive functioning, baseline responses to methamphetamine, severity of methamphetamine use, and methamphetamine-related functional problems.","[{'ForeName': 'Aaron C', 'Initials': 'AC', 'LastName': 'Lim', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Erica N', 'Initials': 'EN', 'LastName': 'Grodin', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Rejoyce', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Green', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Alexandra', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Venegas', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Lindsay R', 'Initials': 'LR', 'LastName': 'Meredith', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kelly E', 'Initials': 'KE', 'LastName': 'Courtney', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Nathasha R', 'Initials': 'NR', 'LastName': 'Moallem', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Philip', 'Initials': 'P', 'LastName': 'Sayegh', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Edythe D', 'Initials': 'ED', 'LastName': 'London', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Lara A', 'Initials': 'LA', 'LastName': 'Ray', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.'}]",The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse,['10.1080/00952990.2020.1741002']

332,32343634,A Multicomponent Nonpharmacological Intervention to Prevent Delirium for Hospitalized People with Advanced Cancer: A Phase II Cluster Randomized Waitlist Controlled Trial (The PRESERVE Pilot Study).,"Background:  Delirium is a common debilitating complication of advanced cancer.  Objective:  To determine if a multicomponent nonpharmacological delirium prevention intervention was feasible for adult patients with advanced cancer, before a phase III (efficacy) trial.  Design:  Phase II (feasibility) cluster randomized controlled trial. All sites implemented delirium screening and diagnostic assessment. Strategies within sleep, vision and hearing, hydration, orientation, mobility, and family domains were delivered to enrolled patients at intervention site admission days 1-7. Control sites then implemented the intervention (""waitlist sites"").  Setting:  Four Australian palliative care units.  Measurements:  The primary outcome was adherence, with an  a priori  endpoint of at least 60% patients achieving full adherence. Secondary outcomes were interdisciplinary care delivery, delirium measures, and adverse events, analyzed descriptively and inferentially.  Results:  Sixty-five enrolled patients (25 control, 20 intervention, and 20 waitlist) had 98% delirium screens and 75% diagnostic assessments completed. Nurses (67%), physicians (16%), allied health (8.4%), family (7%), patients (1%), and volunteers (0.5%) delivered the intervention. There was full adherence for 5% patients at intervention sites, partial for 25%. Both full and partial adherence were higher at waitlist sites: 25% and 45%, respectively. One-third of control site patients (32%) became delirious within seven days of admission compared to one-fifth (20%) at both intervention and waitlist sites ( p  = 0.5). Mean (standard deviation) Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-1998 scores were 16.8 + 12.0 control sites versus 18.4 + 8.2 ( p  = 0.6) intervention and 18.7 + 7.8 ( p  = 0.5) waitlist sites.

333,32343890,Olaparib for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"BACKGROUND


Multiple loss-of-function alterations in genes that are involved in DNA repair, including homologous recombination repair, are associated with response to poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition in patients with prostate and other cancers.
METHODS


We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial evaluating the PARP inhibitor olaparib in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving a new hormonal agent (e.g., enzalutamide or abiraterone). All the men had a qualifying alteration in prespecified genes with a direct or indirect role in homologous recombination repair. Cohort A (245 patients) had at least one alteration in  BRCA1 ,  BRCA2 , or  ATM ; cohort B (142 patients) had alterations in any of 12 other prespecified genes, prospectively and centrally determined from tumor tissue. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to receive olaparib or the physician's choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone (control). The primary end point was imaging-based progression-free survival in cohort A according to blinded independent central review.
RESULTS


In cohort A, imaging-based progression-free survival was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the control group (median, 7.4 months vs. 3.6 months; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.47; P<0.001); a significant benefit was also observed with respect to the confirmed objective response rate and the time to pain progression. The median overall survival in cohort A was 18.5 months in the olaparib group and 15.1 months in the control group; 81% of the patients in the control group who had progression crossed over to receive olaparib. A significant benefit for olaparib was also seen for imaging-based progression-free survival in the overall population (cohorts A and B). Anemia and nausea were the main toxic effects in patients who received olaparib.
CONCLUSIONS


In men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone and who had alterations in genes with a role in homologous recombination repair, olaparib was associated with longer progression-free survival and better measures of response and patient-reported end points than either enzalutamide or abiraterone.

334,32343918,Subcutaneous Lidocaine for Cancer-Related Pain.,"Background:  Intravenous lidocaine infusions have been shown to be effective for cancer related pain, but access is restricted to acute care settings. If able to be shown to be safe and effective, the subcutaneous route could expand access to residential hospices or patients' homes.  Objectives:  This randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, 2 × 2 crossover trial evaluated the effectiveness, safety, toxicity, and impact on quality of life of a limited duration subcutaneous lidocaine infusion (SCLI) for chronic cancer pain.  Methods:  Patients with the life expectancy of three months or more, who were experiencing cancer-related pain with a worst severity of at least 4 on a 0-10 scale despite a trial of at least one opioid and appropriate adjuvant analgesic, received two subcutaneous infusions at least a week apart; lidocaine 10 mg/kg over 5.5 hours and saline placebo. The primary outcome was either a reduction in worst pain intensity of two points out of 10 or a reduction in 24 hours opioid dose of at least 30% without worsening of pain scores, in seven days.  Results:  The SCLI was only effective for two subjects. One of these subjects experienced a drop in worst pain score and the other experienced a reduction in opioid dose.  Conclusions:  A weight-based subcutaneous infusion of lidocaine does not achieve sufficiently predictable blood levels for determining lidocaine responsiveness. This study does not allow any conclusion to be drawn on whether or not lidocaine would have been more effective had it been titrated to higher blood levels.",2020,"The primary outcome was either a reduction in worst pain intensity of two points out of 10 or a reduction in 24 hours opioid dose of at least 30% without worsening of pain scores, in seven days.

JNJ-56136379 (JNJ-6379), a capsid assembly modulator that blocks hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication, was well tolerated and demonstrated dose-proportional pharmacokinetics in healthy participants in part 1 of its first clinical trial. In part 2, we have evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of multiple doses of JNJ-6379 in patients with chronic HBV infection.
METHODS


We performed a double-blind study of 57 treatment-naïve patients with HB e antigen-positive or -negative (74%) chronic HBV infection without cirrhosis. Patients were randomly assigned to groups given JNJ-6379 at 25 mg (100 mg loading dose), 75 mg, 150 mg or 250 mg or placebo daily for 4 weeks with an 8-week follow-up period.
RESULTS


Twenty-three of 41 patients (56%) given JNJ-6379 had at least 1 adverse event (AE) during treatment, compared with 10/16 patients (63%) given placebo. No serious AEs were reported during the treatment period. Three patients (7%) given JNJ-6379 vs none given placebo had grade 3 AEs; of these, 1 patient (150 mg) also had an isolated grade 4 increase in level of alanine aminotransferase that led to treatment discontinuation. JNJ-6379 exposure increased with dose, with time-linear pharmacokinetics. HBV-DNA and HBV-RNA decreased from baseline in patients receiving all doses of JNJ-6379, independently of viral genotype and HB e antigen status. On day 29, 13/41 patients (32%) had levels of HBV DNA below the lower limit of quantification. No clinically significant changes in levels of HB surface antigen were observed.
CONCLUSIONS


In a phase 1 study of treatment-naïve patients with chronic HBV infection, all doses tested of JNJ-6379 were well tolerated, showed dose-dependent pharmacokinetics, and had potent antiviral activity in patients with CHB. The findings support a phase 2a study to evaluate JNJ-6379±nucleos(t)ide analogs in patients with chronic HBV infection, which is underway.

336,32343963,Long-term Noninvasive Ventilation in Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome without Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea.,"BACKGROUND


Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is an effective form of treatment in obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, there is paucity of evidence in OHS patients without severe OSA phenotype.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS


Is NIV effective in OHS without severe OSA phenotype?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS


In this multicenter, open-label parallel group clinical trial performed at 16 sites in Spain, we randomly assigned 98 stable ambulatory patients with untreated OHS and apnea-hypopnea index <30 events/hour (i.e., no severe OSA) to NIV or lifestyle modification (control group) using simple randomization through an electronic database. The primary end point was hospitalization days/year. Secondary endpoints included other hospital resource utilization, incident cardiovascular events, mortality, respiratory functional tests, blood pressure, quality of life, sleepiness and other clinical symptoms. Both investigators and patients were aware of the treatment allocation; however, treating clinicians from the routine care team were not aware of patients' enrollment in the clinical trial. The study was stopped early in its 8 th  year due to difficulty identifying OHS patients without severe OSA. The analysis was performed according to intention-to-treat and per-protocol principles as well as by adherence subgroups.
RESULTS


49 patients in the NIV group and 49 in the control group were randomized and 48 patients in each group were analyzed. During a median [IQR] follow-up of 4.98 [2.98; 6.62] years, mean (SD) hospitalization days/year was 2.60 (5.31) in the control group and 2.71 (4.52) in the NIV group [adjusted rate ratio (95% CI) 1.07 (0.44; 2.59) (p = 0.882)]. NIV therapy, in contrast to control group, produced significant longitudinal improvement in PaCO 2 , pH, bicarbonate, quality of life (SF-36 physical component) and daytime sleepiness. Moreover, per-protocol analysis showed statistically significant difference for the time until the first emergency department visit favoring NIV. In the subgroup with high NIV adherence the time until the first event of hospital admission, emergency department visits and mortality were longer than in the low adherence subgroup. Adverse events were similar between arms.
INTERPRETATION


In stable ambulatory patients with OHS without severe OSA, NIV and lifestyle modification had similar long-term hospitalization days-year. A more intensive program aimed at improving NIV adherence may lead to better outcomes. Larger studies are necessary to better determine the long-term benefit of NIV in this subgroup of OHS.",2020,"NIV therapy, in contrast to control group, produced significant longitudinal improvement in PaCO 2 , pH, bicarbonate, quality of life (SF-36 physical component) and daytime sleepiness.","['49 patients in the NIV group and 49 in the control group were randomized and 48 patients in each group were analyzed', '98 stable ambulatory patients with untreated OHS and apnea-hypopnea index <30 events/hour (i.e., no severe OSA) to', 'obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA', 'Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome without Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'stable ambulatory patients with OHS without severe OSA', 'OHS patients without severe OSA phenotype']","['Long-term Noninvasive Ventilation', 'Noninvasive ventilation (NIV', 'NIV or lifestyle modification (control group) using simple randomization through an electronic database']","['hospitalization days/year', 'PaCO 2 , pH, bicarbonate, quality of life (SF-36 physical component) and daytime sleepiness', 'hospital resource utilization, incident cardiovascular events, mortality, respiratory functional tests, blood pressure, quality of life, sleepiness and other clinical symptoms', 'Adverse events']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C1997883', 'cui_str': 'Noninvasive ventilation'}, {'cui': 'C0439745', 'cui_str': 'Grouped'}, {'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}, {'cui': 'C0205360', 'cui_str': 'Stable'}, {'cui': 'C0002424', 'cui_str': 'Ambulatory care site'}, {'cui': 'C0332155', 'cui_str': 'Did not receive therapy or drug for'}, {'cui': 'C0031880', 'cui_str': 'Extreme obesity with alveolar hypoventilation'}, {'cui': 'C2111846', 'cui_str': 'Apnea Hypopnea Index'}, {'cui': 'C0441471', 'cui_str': 'Event'}, {'cui': 'C0439227', 'cui_str': 'hour'}, {'cui': 'C0205082', 'cui_str': 'Severe'}, {'cui': 'C0520679', 'cui_str': 'Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome'}, {'cui': 'C0031437', 'cui_str': 'Phenotype'}]","[{'cui': 'C0205166', 'cui_str': 'Long'}, {'cui': 'C0233324', 'cui_str': 'Term birth of newborn'}, {'cui': 'C1997883', 'cui_str': 'Noninvasive ventilation'}, {'cui': 'C0023676', 'cui_str': 'Life style'}, {'cui': 'C0392747', 'cui_str': 'Changing'}, {'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}, {'cui': 'C0205352', 'cui_str': 'Simple'}, {'cui': 'C0034656', 'cui_str': 'Randomization'}, {'cui': 'C0013850', 'cui_str': 'Electronic'}, {'cui': 'C0993637', 'cui_str': 'Data Base'}]","[{'cui': 'C0019993', 'cui_str': 'Inpatient care'}, {'cui': 'C0556972', 'cui_str': 'days/year'}, {'cui': 'C0005367', 'cui_str': 'Bicarbonate'}, {'cui': 'C0518214', 'cui_str': 'Quality of life satisfaction'}, {'cui': 'C0031809', 'cui_str': 'Physical examination'}, {'cui': 'C0449432', 'cui_str': 'Component'}, {'cui': 'C0541854', 'cui_str': 'Daytime sleepiness'}, {'cui': 'C0019994', 'cui_str': 'Hospitals'}, {'cui': 'C0035201', 'cui_str': 'Resources'}, {'cui': 'C0042153', 'cui_str': 'utilization'}, {'cui': 'C1320716', 'cui_str': 'Cardiovascular event'}, {'cui': 'C0026565', 'cui_str': 'Mortality rate'}, {'cui': 'C0205245', 'cui_str': 'Functional'}, {'cui': 'C0003647', 'cui_str': 'Aptitude Tests'}, {'cui': 'C0005823', 'cui_str': 'Blood pressure'}, {'cui': 'C0013144', 'cui_str': 'Drowsiness'}, {'cui': 'C0205210', 'cui_str': 'Clinical'}, {'cui': 'C0683368', 'cui_str': 'symptoms'}, {'cui': 'C0877248', 'cui_str': 'Adverse event'}]",98.0,0.143898,"NIV therapy, in contrast to control group, produced significant longitudinal improvement in PaCO 2 , pH, bicarbonate, quality of life (SF-36 physical component) and daytime sleepiness.","[{'ForeName': 'Juan F', 'Initials': 'JF', 'LastName': 'Masa', 'Affiliation': 'Respiratory Department.

337,32350175,Liver-Oriented Acute Metabolic Effects of A Low Dose of L-Carnitine under Fat-Mobilizing Conditions: Pilot Human Clinical Trial.,"The acute metabolic effect of low dosages of L-carnitine under fat-mobilizing conditions was investigated. Healthy subjects (Study 1: n=5; Study 2: n=6) were asked to fast overnight. Then, 30 min of aerobic exercise on a cycle ergometer was performed after supplementation, followed by a 3.5-h sedentary recovery phase. The following ingestion patterns were used: Study 1 (i) noningestion, (ii) 750 mg of L-carnitine (LC), and (iii) 750 mg of LC+50 g of carbohydrate (CHO); Study 2 (iv) noningestion, (v) 500 mg of LC, (vi) 30 mg of CoQ 10 , and (vii) 500 mg of LC+30 mg of CoQ 10 . The energy expenditure (EE) and nonprotein respiratory quotient (npRQ) were measured during the pre-exercise, postexercise, and recovery periods. Serum free carnitine, acetylcarnitine, total carnitine (Study 1 and 2), and ketone bodies (Study 2) were measured. The 750 mg LC treatment significantly facilitated fat oxidation during the recovery phases (p<0.05) without elevating EE. The higher fat oxidation associated with LC was completely suppressed by CHO. CoQ 10  affected neither npRQ nor EE. npRQ was significantly correlated with the serum total ketone bodies (R=-0.68, p<0.001) and acetylcarnitine (R=-0.61--0.70, p<0.001). The highest correlation was found between acetylcarnitine and total ketone bodies immediately after exercise (R=0.85, p<0.001).

338,32350176,Pre-Exercise Glucose Ingestion May Improve Endurance Capacity in East Asian Student Athletes with Lower Blood Glucose Response.,"The main purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of pre-exercise glucose ingestion after a 2.5-h fast on the endurance capacity and blood glucose response in East Asian athletes who is expected to have genetically low insulin response. A total of 8 Japanese student athletes ingested 1.5 g/kg body mass of glucose (G trial) or 0.5 g/kg body mass of artificial sweetener dissolved in water (P trial) 30 min before exercise test after consuming a standardized breakfast. The exercise test comprised 40 min cycling exercise at 50% maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2max ), immediately followed by cycling to exhaustion at 70% VO 2max . Before analyzing the data, we grouped the subjects into two groups depending on whether they showed rapid increase in blood glucose at the onset of exercise (increase rate in LOW group is <20% and HIGH group is ≥20%) to evaluate subject's insulin response to glucose feeding. No subjects developed rebound hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) in the G trial of both group. Significantly higher blood glucose during exercise was recognized only in the G trial of LOW group. Although no significant difference was observed between the two trials of both group, cycling time to exhaustion in the LOW group tended to increase because of glucose ingestion. These results suggest that pre-exercise ingestion of glucose in East Asian student athletes does not induce rebound hypoglycemia regardless of difference in individual insulin responses. Furthermore, individuals with low insulin responses seem to improve endurance performance with glucose ingestion before exercise.",2020,"Although no significant difference was observed between the two trials of both group, cycling time to exhaustion in the LOW group tended to increase because of glucose ingestion.","['East Asian athletes who is expected to have genetically low insulin response', '8 Japanese student athletes ingested 1.5 g/kg body mass of glucose (G trial) or 0.5 g/kg body mass of artificial sweetener dissolved in water (P trial) 30 min before exercise test after consuming a standardized breakfast', 'East Asian student athletes', 'East Asian Student Athletes with Lower Blood Glucose Response']","['Pre-Exercise Glucose Ingestion', 'exercise test comprised 40 min cycling exercise at 50% maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2max ', 'pre-exercise glucose ingestion']","['blood glucose', 'cycling time to exhaustion', 'glucose ingestion', 'rebound hypoglycemia', 'endurance capacity and blood glucose response']","[{'cui': 'C0078988', 'cui_str': 'Oriental'}, {'cui': 'C0238703', 'cui_str': 'Athletes'}, {'cui': 'C0861023', 'cui_str': 'Insulin low'}, {'cui': 'C0376247', 'cui_str': 'Japanese language'}, {'cui': 'C0038492', 'cui_str': 'Student'}, {'cui': 'C0232478', 'cui_str': 'Ingestion'}, {'cui': 'C3844012', 'cui_str': '1.5'}, {'cui': 'C1300563', 'cui_str': 'g/kg'}, {'cui': 'C0152338', 'cui_str': 'Structure of body of caudate nucleus'}, {'cui': 'C0577559', 'cui_str': 'Mass of body structure'}, {'cui': 'C0017725', 'cui_str': 'Glucose'}, {'cui': 'C0008976', 'cui_str': 'Clinical trial'}, {'cui': 'C0444500', 'cui_str': '0.5'}, {'cui': 'C0003920', 'cui_str': 'Artificial sweetener'}, {'cui': 'C1549535', 'cui_str': 'Dissolve'}, {'cui': 'C0020311', 'cui_str': 'Hydrotherapy'}, {'cui': 'C0456693', 'cui_str': '/30 min'}, {'cui': 'C0585043', 'cui_str': 'Before exercise'}, {'cui': 'C0003647', 'cui_str': 'Aptitude Tests'}, {'cui': 'C2698559', 'cui_str': 'Breakfast time'}, {'cui': 'C0020615', 'cui_str': 'Hypoglycemia'}]","[{'cui': 'C0032952', 'cui_str': 'Prednisone'}, {'cui': 'C0015259', 'cui_str': 'Exercise'}, {'cui': 'C0017725', 'cui_str': 'Glucose'}, {'cui': 'C0232478', 'cui_str': 'Ingestion'}, {'cui': 'C0015260', 'cui_str': 'Exercise tolerance test'}, {'cui': 'C0439232', 'cui_str': 'min'}, {'cui': 'C0205289', 'cui_str': 'Maximal'}, {'cui': 'C0429627', 'cui_str': 'Oxygen uptake'}]","[{'cui': 'C0005802', 'cui_str': 'Glucose, Blood'}, {'cui': 'C0040223', 'cui_str': 'Time'}, {'cui': 'C0392674', 'cui_str': 'Exhaustion'}, {'cui': 'C0017725', 'cui_str': 'Glucose'}, {'cui': 'C0232478', 'cui_str': 'Ingestion'}, {'cui': 'C0020615', 'cui_str': 'Hypoglycemia'}, {'cui': 'C0518031', 'cui_str': 'Endurance'}]",8.0,0.0228307,"Although no significant difference was observed between the two trials of both group, cycling time to exhaustion in the LOW group tended to increase because of glucose ingestion.","[{'ForeName': 'Rikuhide', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Koma', 'Affiliation': 'School of Regional Development Studies, Graduate School of Human and Socio-Environmental Studies, Kanazawa University.'}, {'ForeName': 'Naoko', 'Initials': 'N', 'LastName': 'Terasawa', 'Affiliation': 'Faculty of Human Science, Kanazawa University.'}]",Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,['10.3177/jnsv.66.150']
339,32350185,Efficacy of Improvised Topical Zinc (1%) Ora-Base on Oral Mucositis during Cancer Chemo-Radiation-A Randomized Study.,"Oral mucositis refers to erythematous and ulcerative lesions of oral mucosa during chemo/radiotherapy. Treatment modalities were directed towards reduction in severity of oral mucositis. Zinc plays an important role to retard oxidative processes and is considered as the critical component in wound healing. To compare the efficacy of zinc alone with improvised zinc preparation in reducing the severity of oral mucositis. Improvised zinc was a combination of zinc oxide, amla, tulsi and curcumin at 1% therapeutic concentrations. Seventy-five subjects undergoing chemo/radiotherapy were randomly divided into three groups: Group A (25 subjects) had received topical 5% zinc oxide paste trice daily application after food for entire treatment period, initiated 2 d prior to radiotherapy. Group B (25) received improvised zinc preparations (1%) and instructed to apply same as group A. Group C (25) received standard treatment offered by cancer hospital. All the groups were assessed for oral mucositis using WHO grading system at 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, 35th day by the oncologist and results were tabulated for statistical analysis. Severity of oral mucositis reduced in zinc and improvised zinc group (p=0.096) when compared with controls with significant p value (0.037). Comparison of improvised zinc preparation (1%) group with only zinc group revealed that severity of overall mucositis though was not significant, was less in improvised zinc group with p value (0.029, 0.013) at 28 and 35 d respectively.

Ninety patients requiring corticosteroid injections for trigger finger were randomized to three groups: SSIDB with 2 ml of 1% lidocaine, SSIDB with 1 ml of 1% lidocaine and no digital block (control group). In SSIDB groups, the intrasynovial corticosteroid injections were performed after digital nerve block. In control group, ethyl chloride spray was applied prior to intrasynovial injection of the corticosteroid and 1% lidocaine mixture. The pain during lidocaine needle insertion, lidocaine infiltration, corticosteroid needle insertion and corticosteroid infiltration were determined with a visual analog scale (VAS).
RESULTS


The VAS pain scores for corticosteroid needle insertion in both SSIDB groups were significantly lower than the VAS pain scores in control group (p < 0.001). The VAS pain score during corticosteroid infiltration in 2 ml of 1% lidocaine group was significantly lower than 1 ml of 1% lidocaine group (p = 0.008), and in control group (p < 0.001). Pain during nerve block procedure in both SSIDB groups was significantly lower than the pain from corticosteroid injection in the control group (p < 0.05 and p < 0.05).

343,32350785,Coagulation ability when separating from cardiopulmonary bypass with and without fresh frozen plasma: a pilot study.,"OBJECTIVE


Several strategies are employed for administering fresh frozen plasma (FFP) during weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). This study evaluated by coagulation function aimed to compare two strategies of administering FFP in cardiovascular surgery: administering 4 units of FFP before separating from CPB or administering it after weaning from CPB.
METHODS


Thirty patients who underwent CPB and were expected to receive 8 units of FFP and 20 units of platelet concentrate were randomly allocated into group A (8 units of FFP and 20 units of platelet concentrate administered after separating from CPB) and group B (4 units of FFP administered before separation, and 4 units of FFP and 20 units of platelet concentrate administered after separating from CPB). Thromboelastography (TEG6s ® , HAEMONETICS Japan GK, Tokyo, Japan) was conducted at four time points before and after separation. Blood test results, blood loss, and required amounts of blood transfusion were compared. The primary outcome was the difference in coagulation function evaluated by TEG6s 90 min after protamine administration.
RESULTS


Twenty-eight patients were enrolled in the study. Coagulation function after separating from CPB was not significantly different between the groups. Additionally, no significant differences were found in intensive care unit outcomes, such as 24-h transfusion requirements.
CONCLUSIONS

To evaluate the feasibility and potential efficacy of nanocurcumin supplementation in patients with localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) undergoing induction chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS


In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 26 MIBC patients were randomized to receive either nanocurcumin (180 mg/day) or placebo during the course of chemotherapy. All patients were followed up to four weeks after the end of treatment to assess the complete clinical response to the chemotherapy as primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were the comparisons of chemotherapy?induced nephrotoxicity, hematologic nadirs, and toxicities between the two groups. Hematologic nadirs and toxicities were assessed during the treatment.
RESULTS


Nanocurcumin was well tolerated. The complete clinical response rates were 30.8 and 50% in the placebo and nanocurcumin groups, respectively. Although nanocurcumin was shown to be superior to placebo with respect to complete clinical response rates as the primary endpoint, there was no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.417). No significant difference was also found between the two groups with regard to grade 3/4 renal and hematologic toxicities as well as hematologic nadirs.
CONCLUSION


These preliminary data indicate the feasibility of nanocurcumin supplementation as a complementary therapy in MIBC patients and support further larger studies. Moreover, a substantial translational insight to fill the gap between the experiment and clinical practice in the field is provided.",2020,"No significant difference was also found between the two groups with regard to grade 3/4 renal and hematologic toxicities as well as hematologic nadirs.

347,32350903,A randomized controlled trial of the effects of non-surgical periodontal therapy on cardiac function assessed by echocardiography in type 2 diabetic patients.,"BACKGROUND


Periodontitis significantly increases the risk of diabetic complications. This clinical trial investigated the effects of periodontal therapy on cardiac function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and periodontitis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS


Fifty-eight subjects with T2DM and periodontitis were randomly allocated to Treatment Group (n = 29) receiving non-surgical periodontal therapy, and Control Group (n = 29) having only oral hygiene instructions with delayed periodontal treatment until completion of this 6-month study. The left ventricle (LV) diastolic function was assessed by echocardiography with the tissue Doppler imaging index (E/e' ratio); and LV hypertrophy was evaluated by LV mass index (LVMI). Blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis.
RESULTS


The intention-to-treat analysis showed that periodontal treatment significantly reduced the E/e' ratio by 1.66 (95% CI: -2.64 to -0.68, p < .01), along with marked improvement of periodontal conditions (p < .05). LVMI was not altered at the 6-month follow-up.

348,32344167,Umifenovir treatment is not associated with improved outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019: a retrospective study.,"OBJECTIVES


Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Umifenovir (Arbidol®) is an antiviral drug being used to treat influenza in Russia and China. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of umifenovir for COVID-19.
METHODS


A retrospective study was performed in a non-intensive care unit (ICU) ward in Jinyintan Hospital from 2 February 2020 to 20 March 2020. COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of pharyngeal swab specimens. The confirmed patients were divided into the umifenovir group and the control group according to the use of umifenovir. The main outcomes were the rate of negative pharyngeal swab tests for SARS-CoV-2 within 1 week after admission and the time for the virus to turn negative. The negativity time of SARS-CoV-2 was defined as the first day of a negative test if the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 was negative for two consecutive tests.
RESULTS


A total of 81 COVID-19 patients were included, with 45 in the umifenovir group and 36 in the control group. Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were comparable between the two groups. Thirty-three out of 45 (73%) patients in the umifenovir group tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 within 7 days after admission, the number was 28/36 (78%) in the control group (p 0.19). The median time from onset of symptoms to SARS-CoV-2 turning negative was 18 days (interquartile range (IQR) 12-21) in the umifenovir group and 16 days (IQR 11-21) in the control group (p 0.42). Patients in the umifenovir group had a longer hospital stay than patients in the control group (13 days (IQR 9-17) vs 11 days (IQR 9-14), p 0.04). No deaths or severe adverse reactions were found in both groups.

349,32344176,Imagining a positive future reduces cortisol response to awakening and reactivity to acute stress.,"The positive influence of optimism on health is thought to be due in part to a reduced physiological response to stress, as manifested for instance in activity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) systems. Results of previous studies support the notion that dispositional optimism can influence diurnal cortisol secretion as well as cortisol reactivity. The aim of the present study was to examine whether induced optimism can similarly affect HPA activity and thereby potentially have beneficial health effects. We assigned 66 university students to either the Best Possible Self (BPS) or an active control condition, respectively entailing two weeks of daily visualization of a positive future or time management exercises. Before and after the intervention, we assessed diurnal cortisol levels, response to awakening (CAR), and reactivity to the Trier Social Stress Task (TSST), as well as optimism, affect, negative cognitions, perceived stress, and threat appraisal. Effects of the BPS intervention were tested with repeated measures ANOVA (psychological outcomes) and multilevel regression (cortisol outcomes). The BPS intervention was associated with decreases in both the CAR and cortisol responses to acute stress. Compared to controls, BPS participants showed decreased worrying and increased positive affect post-intervention; however, they did not show the expected greater increase in optimism. Within-person decreases in worrying were associated with decreased CARs, whereas both decreased worrying and increased PA were linked to attenuated stress reactivity. Results suggest that the BPS intervention can influence HPA axis reactivity, with effects on well-being variables likely mediating the process. More research is needed to determine longer-term neuroendocrine and health effects of such interventions in at-risk as well as healthy populations.",2020,"Compared to controls, BPS participants showed decreased worrying and increased positive affect post-intervention; however, they did not show the expected greater increase in optimism.",['66 university students to either the'],"['BPS intervention', 'Best Possible Self (BPS) or an active control condition, respectively entailing two weeks of daily visualization of a positive future or time management exercises']","['optimism', 'CAR and cortisol responses', 'cortisol response', 'diurnal cortisol levels, response to awakening (CAR), and reactivity to the Trier Social Stress Task (TSST), as well as optimism, affect, negative cognitions, perceived stress, and threat appraisal', 'HPA axis reactivity', 'HPA activity', 'diurnal cortisol secretion']","[{'cui': 'C0041740', 'cui_str': 'University'}, {'cui': 'C0038492', 'cui_str': 'Student'}]","[{'cui': 'C0038848', 'cui_str': 'Supplies'}, {'cui': 'C0332149', 'cui_str': 'Possible'}, {'cui': 'C0036588', 'cui_str': 'Self'}, {'cui': 'C0184661', 'cui_str': 'Procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0205177', 'cui_str': 'Active'}, {'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}, {'cui': 'C0009647', 'cui_str': 'Conditioning'}, {'cui': 'C4082118', 'cui_str': 'Two weeks'}, {'cui': 'C0332173', 'cui_str': 'Daily'}, {'cui': 'C0234621', 'cui_str': 'Visual'}, {'cui': 'C1446409', 'cui_str': 'Positive'}, {'cui': 'C0016884', 'cui_str': 'Future'}, {'cui': 'C0206209', 'cui_str': 'Time Management'}, {'cui': 'C0015259', 'cui_str': 'Exercise'}]","[{'cui': 'C0237428', 'cui_str': 'Positive attitude'}, {'cui': 'C0004381', 'cui_str': 'Automobile'}, {'cui': 'C0020268', 'cui_str': 'Hydrocortisone'}, {'cui': 'C0332169', 'cui_str': 'Daytime'}, {'cui': 'C0201968', 'cui_str': 'Cortisol measurement'}, {'cui': 'C1720052', 'cui_str': 'Awakening'}, {'cui': 'C0443286', 'cui_str': 'Reaction'}, {'cui': 'C0038435', 'cui_str': 'Stress'}, {'cui': 'C0065404', 'cui_str': 'lysyl-5-fluorotryptophyl-lysine'}, {'cui': 'C0001721', 'cui_str': 'Affect'}, {'cui': 'C0205160', 'cui_str': 'Negative'}, {'cui': 'C0009240', 'cui_str': 'Cognitive Function'}, {'cui': 'C0030971', 'cui_str': 'Perception'}, {'cui': 'C0020663', 'cui_str': 'Hypothalamic structure'}, {'cui': 'C0032022', 'cui_str': 'Pituitary-Adrenal System'}, {'cui': 'C0032002', 'cui_str': 'Disorder of pituitary gland'}, {'cui': 'C0001625', 'cui_str': 'Adrenal structure'}, {'cui': 'C0026606', 'cui_str': 'Physical activity'}, {'cui': 'C0036536', 'cui_str': 'secretion'}]",66.0,0.0181314,"Compared to controls, BPS participants showed decreased worrying and increased positive affect post-intervention; however, they did not show the expected greater increase in optimism.","[{'ForeName': 'Nancy A', 'Initials': 'NA', 'LastName': 'Nicolson', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry & Neuropsychology, School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Maastricht University, Universiteitssingel 40, 6229ER Maastricht, the Netherlands.

350,32344198,Ileo-colonic delivery of conjugated bile acids improves glucose homeostasis via colonic GLP-1-producing enteroendocrine cells in human obesity and diabetes.,"BACKGROUND


The bile acid (BA) pathway plays a role in regulation of food intake and glucose metabolism, based mainly on findings in animal models. Our aim was to determine whether the BA pathway is altered and correctable in human obesity and diabetes.
METHODS


We conducted 3 investigations: 1) BA receptor pathways were studied in NCI-H716 enteroendocrine cell (EEC) line, whole human colonic mucosal tissue and in human colonic EEC isolated by Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (ex vivo) from endoscopically-obtained biopsies colon mucosa; 2) We characterized the BA pathway in 307 participants by measuring during fasting and postprandial levels of FGF19, 7αC4 and serum BA; 3) In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised, 28-day trial, we studied the effect of ileo-colonic delivery of conjugated BAs (IC-CBAS) on glucose metabolism, incretins, and lipids, in participants with obesity and diabetes.
FINDINGS


Human colonic GLP-1-producing EECs express TGR5, and upon treatment with bile acids in vitro, human EEC differentially expressed GLP-1 at the protein and mRNA level. In Ussing Chamber, GLP-1 release was stimulated by Taurocholic acid in either the apical or basolateral compartment. FGF19 was decreased in obesity and diabetes compared to controls. When compared to placebo, IC-CBAS significantly decreased postprandial glucose, fructosamine, fasting insulin, fasting LDL, and postprandial FGF19 and increased postprandial GLP-1 and C-peptide. Increase in faecal BA was associated with weight loss and with decreased fructosamine.
INTERPRETATIONS


In humans, BA signalling machinery is expressed in colonic EECs, deficient in obesity and diabetes, and when stimulated with IC-CBAS, improved glucose homeostasis. ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02871882, NCT02033876.

351,32344201,Continuous postoperative pericardial flushing method versus standard care for wound drainage after adult cardiac surgery: A randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND


Excessive bleeding, incomplete wound drainage, and subsequent accumulation of blood and clots in the pericardium have been associated with a broad spectrum of bleeding-related complications after cardiac surgery. We developed and studied the continuous postoperative pericardial flushing (CPPF) method to improve wound drainage and reduce blood loss and bleeding-related complications.
METHODS


We conducted a single-center, open-label, ITT, randomized controlled trial at the Academic Medical Center Amstserdam. Adults undergoing cardiac surgery for non-emergent valvular or congenital heart disease (CHD) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive CPPF method or standard care. The primary outcome was actual blood loss after 12-hour stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Secondary outcomes included bleeding-related complications and clinical outcome after six months follow-up.
FINDINGS


Between May 2013 and February 2016, 170 patients were randomly allocated to CPPF method (study group; n = 80) or to standard care (control group; n = 90). CPPF significantly reduced blood loss after 12-hour stay in the ICU (-41%) when compared to standard care (median differences -155 ml, 95% confidence interval (CI) -310 to 0; p=≤0·001). Cardiac tamponade and reoperation for bleeding did not occur in the study group versus one and three in the control group, respectively. At discharge from hospital, patients in the study group were less likely to have pleural effusion in a surgically opened pleural cavity (22% vs. 36%; p = 0·043).
INTERPRETATION


Our study results indicate that CPPF is a safe and effective method to improve chest tube patency and reduce blood loss after cardiac surgery. Larger trials are needed to draw final conclusions concerning the effectiveness of CPPF on clinically relevant outcomes.",2020,"Cardiac tamponade and reoperation for bleeding did not occur in the study group versus one and three in the control group, respectively.","['wound drainage after adult cardiac surgery', 'Between May 2013 and February 2016, 170 patients', 'Adults undergoing cardiac surgery for non-emergent valvular or congenital heart disease (CHD']","['CPPF', 'CPPF method or standard care', 'Continuous postoperative pericardial flushing method versus standard care', 'CPPF method (study group; n\u202f=\u202f80) or to standard care (control group; n\u202f=\u202f90']","['actual blood loss after 12-hour stay in the intensive care unit (ICU', 'Cardiac tamponade and reoperation for bleeding', 'pleural effusion', 'bleeding-related complications and clinical outcome after six months follow-up', 'blood loss']","[{'cui': 'C0016204', 'cui_str': 'Flatus'}, {'cui': 'C0012621', 'cui_str': 'Discharge'}, {'cui': 'C0001675', 'cui_str': 'Adult'}, {'cui': 'C0018821', 'cui_str': 'Operation on heart'}, {'cui': 'C4517599', 'cui_str': '170'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0152021', 'cui_str': 'Congenital heart disease'}]","[{'cui': 'C0549178', 'cui_str': 'Continuous'}, {'cui': 'C0032790', 'cui_str': 'Postoperative period'}, {'cui': 'C0442031', 'cui_str': 'Pericardial'}, {'cui': 'C0016382', 'cui_str': 'Flushing'}, {'cui': 'C0025663', 'cui_str': 'Method'}, {'cui': 'C0038137', 'cui_str': 'standards'}, {'cui': 'C0008972', 'cui_str': 'Clinical Study'}, {'cui': 'C0439745', 'cui_str': 'Grouped'}, {'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}]","[{'cui': 'C0553700', 'cui_str': 'Actual blood loss'}, {'cui': 'C1292430', 'cui_str': '12 hours'}, {'cui': 'C0021708', 'cui_str': 'Intensive care unit'}, {'cui': 'C0007177', 'cui_str': 'Cardiac tamponade'}, {'cui': 'C0035110', 'cui_str': 'Reoperation'}, {'cui': 'C0019080', 'cui_str': 'Hemorrhage'}, {'cui': 'C0032227', 'cui_str': 'Pleural effusion'}, {'cui': 'C0439849', 'cui_str': 'Relationships'}, {'cui': 'C0009566', 'cui_str': 'Complication'}, {'cui': 'C0205210', 'cui_str': 'Clinical'}, {'cui': 'C1274040', 'cui_str': 'Result'}, {'cui': 'C4082120', 'cui_str': 'Six months'}, {'cui': 'C0589120', 'cui_str': 'Follow-up status'}]",170.0,0.171937,"Cardiac tamponade and reoperation for bleeding did not occur in the study group versus one and three in the control group, respectively.","[{'ForeName': 'Eva', 'Initials': 'E', 'LastName': 'Diephuis', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Amsterdam University Medical Center, Location AMC, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

353,32344728,Impact of Active and Passive Hypoxia as Re-Warm-Up Activities on Rugby Players' Performance.,"The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of four types of re-warm-up (R-WU) activity, namely rest in normoxia (RN) at FiO 2  = 20.9%, rest in hypoxia (RH) at FiO 2  = 15%, activity (4 × 5 jumps/15 s) in normoxia (AN) and activity in hypoxia (AH) on physical performance. Ten elite male rugby players completed a 15-min warm-up followed by one of the 15-min randomized R-WU strategies. After R-WU, countermovement jump (CMJ), 20 m sprint and repeat sprint ability (RSA) tests were assessed. Compared to passive strategies (RN and RH), tympanic temperature was higher after active R-WU (AN and AH) ( p  = 0.016). Higher values of CMJ height ( p  = 0.037) and 20 m sprint ( p  = 0.02) were found in AH than in RN. In addition, mean RSA was lower ( p  = 0.008) in AH than in RN and RH.

354,32344735,The Usefulness of Serum Biomarkers in the Early Stages of Diabetic Retinopathy: Results of the EUROCONDOR Clinical Trial.,"The main aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of serum biomarkers to predict the worsening of retinal neurodysfunction in subjects with type 2 diabetes. For this purpose, we measured selected molecules (N-epsilon-carboxy methyl lysine (CML), laminin P1 (Lam-P1), and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA)) in the serum of 341 participants of the EUROCONDOR study at baseline, 24, and 48 weeks. Retinal neurodysfunction was assessed by measuring implicit time (IT) using multifocal electroretinography, and structural changes were examined by spectral domain-optical coherence tomography. The values of IT at baseline were directly correlated with baseline serum concentrations of CML ( r  = 0.135,  p  = 0.013). Furthermore, in the placebo group, increase in CML concentration throughout follow-up correlated with the IT ( r  = 0.20;  p  = 0.03). Baseline serum levels of CML also correlated with macular retinal thickness (RT) ( r  = 0.231;  p  < 0.001). Baseline Lam-P1 levels correlated with the increase of the RT at the end of follow-up in the placebo group ( r  = 0.22;  p  = 0.016). We provide evidence that CML may be a biomarker of both retinal neurodysfunction and RT, whereas Lam-P1 was associated with RT only. Therefore, circulating levels of these molecules could provide a complementary tool for monitoring the early changes of diabetic retinopathy (DR).",2020,Baseline Lam-P1 levels correlated with the increase of the RT at the end of follow-up in the placebo group ( r  = 0.22;  p  = 0.016).,"['341 participants of the EUROCONDOR study at baseline, 24, and 48 weeks', 'subjects with type 2 diabetes', 'Diabetic Retinopathy']",['placebo'],"['Baseline serum levels of CML', 'macular retinal thickness (RT', 'Baseline Lam-P1 levels', 'implicit time (IT) using multifocal electroretinography, and structural changes', 'selected molecules (N-epsilon-carboxy methyl lysine (CML), laminin P1 (Lam-P1), and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA', 'CML concentration']","[{'cui': 'C0008972', 'cui_str': 'Clinical Study'}, {'cui': 'C0168634', 'cui_str': 'BaseLine dental cement'}, {'cui': 'C0439230', 'cui_str': 'week'}, {'cui': 'C0332307', 'cui_str': 'Type - attribute'}, {'cui': 'C0011884', 'cui_str': 'Retinopathy due to diabetes mellitus'}]","[{'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}]","[{'cui': 'C0168634', 'cui_str': 'BaseLine dental cement'}, {'cui': 'C0229671', 'cui_str': 'Serum'}, {'cui': 'C0441889', 'cui_str': 'Levels'}, {'cui': 'C0023473', 'cui_str': 'Chronic myeloid leukemia'}, {'cui': 'C0035298', 'cui_str': 'Retinal structure'}, {'cui': 'C1280412', 'cui_str': 'Thick'}, {'cui': 'C0065041', 'cui_str': 'lipoarabinomannan'}, {'cui': 'C0040223', 'cui_str': 'Time'}, {'cui': 'C1627756', 'cui_str': 'Multifocal electroretinography'}, {'cui': 'C0037400', 'cui_str': 'Social Change'}, {'cui': 'C0567416', 'cui_str': 'Molecule'}, {'cui': 'C0113456', 'cui_str': ""di(1,N(6)-ethenoadenosine)-5',5'''-P(1),P(4)-tetraphosphate""}, {'cui': 'C0024337', 'cui_str': 'Lysine'}, {'cui': 'C0064633', 'cui_str': 'laminin P1'}, {'cui': 'C0067385', 'cui_str': 'N,N-dimethylarginine'}, {'cui': 'C0004268', 'cui_str': 'Attention'}]",341.0,0.09547,Baseline Lam-P1 levels correlated with the increase of the RT at the end of follow-up in the placebo group ( r  = 0.22;  p  = 0.016).,"[{'ForeName': 'Cristina', 'Initials': 'C', 'LastName': 'Hernández', 'Affiliation': ""Diabetes and Metabolism Research Unit and CIBERDEM, Vall d'Hebron Research Institute, 08035 Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'ForeName': 'Massimo', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Porta', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, 10124 Turin, Italy.'}, {'ForeName': 'Francesco', 'Initials': 'F', 'LastName': 'Bandello', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Scientific Institute San Raffaele, University Vita-Salute, 20132 Milano, Italy.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jakob', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Grauslund', 'Affiliation': 'Research Unit of Ophthalmology, Department of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, 5230 Odense, Denmark.'}, {'ForeName': 'Simon P', 'Initials': 'SP', 'LastName': 'Harding', 'Affiliation': ""Department of Eye & Vision Science, Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, University of Liverpool, and St. Pauls' Eye Unit.

355,32344842,The Effects of Vitamin D Supplementation on Lipid and Inflammatory Profile of Healthy Adolescent Boys: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND


Deficiency of vitamin D, an anti-inflammatory micronutrient with some favorable effects on lipid profiles, has been found to be highly prevalent in adolescents. We aimed to investigate the effect of a school-based vitamin D supplementation regimen on the correction of vitamin D deficiency as well as lipid and inflammatory profiles of healthy adolescent boys.
METHODS


In this randomized single-blind placebo-controlled trial, seventy-one healthy adolescent boys (age 17 years old) were recruited from one high school in Tehran, Iran, and randomly assigned to two groups. The supplement group received vitamin D pearls at a dose of 50,000 IU monthly for 6 months, this dose is indeed defined by the Ministry of Health in Iran for a potential national school-based vitamin D supplementation program. The other group was given placebo pearls for the same duration. Before and after the treatment, the serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH) D), parathyroid hormone (PTH), retinol, lead (Pb), the lipid profile and the inflammatory biomarkers were measured and compared.
RESULTS


Between-groups statistical analysis showed that a dose (50,000 IU/month) vitamin D significantly increased the serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) ( p  < 0.001) and decreased serum levels of PTH ( p  = 0.003). No significant change was observed in serum levels of retinol and Pb. Between-group analysis revealed that the serum levels of TG (P = 0.001) decreased while an increase in serum levels of HDL ( p  = 0.021) was observed ( p  < 0.05).

Objective:  To evaluate the usefulness of dermoscopy in determining MMS surgical margins of BCCs with a history of ablative laser treatment. Methods:  Patients were randomly allocated to naked eye (n = 69) or dermoscopy (n = 64) groups by the surgical margin detection method. Surgical outcomes of 133 post-laser BCC patients treated with MMS were analyzed. Results:  The lateral margin involvement rate at the first MMS stage was significantly lower in the dermoscopy group than in the naked eye group (4.7% vs. 29.0%;  P <.001). However, the deep margin involvement rate at the first and mean MMS stages were not significantly different between the groups. The ablative laser treatment duration correlated to the number of MMS stages ( P =.026).

Moreover, despite the potential metabolic effect of resistance training on insulin resistance, aging, and T2D; the effect of this type of exercise training on FGF-21 and myostatin in elderly men with and without T2D are unknown. Forty-four elderly men were assigned to either the RT training (RT; without T2D: 12, with TD2 = 10) or the control group (C; without T2D: 12, with TD2 = 10). The RT group performed 12-wk resistance training intervention, 3 days/wk, 10 repetitions with 70% 1RM. At the baseline, the elderly men with T2D had a higher FGF-21 (p=0.002) and myostatin (p=0.02) concentrations and lower muscle strength (p=0.01) than the elderly men without T2D. RT resulted in significant decrease in FGF-21 and myostatin concentration and increase in muscle strength in both elderly men with and without T2D (P=0.001, for all) as well as decrease in HOMA-IR in only elderly men without T2D (P=0.001).

358,32345170,Quantitative measurement properties and score interpretation of the Cough Severity Diary in patients with chronic cough.,"AIMS


The Cough Severity Diary (CSD) was developed in accordance with the FDA guidance for patient-reported outcome measures and is focused on capturing the patient's perception of cough in terms of frequency, intensity, and disruption due to their cough. The measure includes a series of seven items asking patients to rate the frequency (three items), intensity (two items), and disruptiveness (two items) of their cough. The instrument was designed to be completed daily before bedtime, has a recall period of 'today,' and responses to items are entered on an 11-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 to 10 with anchors on each end. The objective of this analysis was to confirm the domain structure of the CSD and assess its reliability, validity, and responsiveness in adult patients with refractory or unexplained chronic cough (RCC/UCC). Criteria for defining meaningful changes in mean weekly CSD total and domain scores in the context of a clinical trial were also developed.
METHODS


Pooled data from a phase II randomized controlled trial of an investigational treatment for RCC/UCC were analyzed. Participants were non-smokers, had RCC/UCC for ⩾1 year, and a baseline cough severity visual analogue scale (VAS) ⩾40 mm. CSD scores (baseline, week 4), were analyzed; the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ), cough severity VAS, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and objective cough frequency counts were used for validation. CSD domain structure (Total, Frequency, Intensity, Disruption) was assessed for scoring.
RESULTS


A total of 253 participants were included (mean age 60.2; 76% female). Global fit of the three-factor CSD was acceptable. For the CSD total score, internal consistency (α = 0.89) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.68) were high. CSD total scores were correlated with the LCQ total ( r  = -0.62) and cough severity VAS ( r  = 0.84). Participants with a PGIC score of 1 or 2 (most improved groups) had the greatest mean score improvement on the CSD Total (Day 0 to Day 28), supporting responsiveness (similar findings for subscales). A change threshold of ⩾1.3-point reduction on the total and subscale scores is appropriate to define clinically meaningful improvement.
CONCLUSION


The CSD is a reliable, valid, and responsive measure of cough symptom severity in patients with refractory or unexplained chronic cough and fit-for-purpose for assessing changes in cough severity in clinical trials.

Undernutrition during pregnancy affects birth outcomes adversely. In Ethiopia, despite nutrition counseling on the maternal diet being given by the health workers during pregnancy, maternal undernutrition is still high in the country. Hence, this study aimed to assess the effect of guided counseling using the health belief model and the theory of planned behavior on the nutritional status of pregnant women.
METHODS


A two-arm parallel cluster randomized controlled community trial was conducted in West Gojjam Zone, Ethiopia, from May 1, 2018, to April 30, 2019. The nutritional status of the women was assessed using mid-upper arm circumference. A total of 694 pregnant women were recruited from the intervention (n=346 ) and control (n=348) clusters. Of which endline data were collected from 313 and 332 pregnant women in the intervention and control clusters, respectively. The intervention was started before 16 weeks of gestation and pregnant women in the intervention group attended 4 counseling sessions. Counseling was given at the participants' homes using a counseling guide with the core contents of the intervention. Leaflets with appropriate pictures and the core messages were given for women in the intervention arm. Women in the control group got the routine nutrition education given by the health care system. Data were collected using interviewer administered structured questionnaires and mid-upper arm circumference was measured using an adult MUAC tape. Descriptive statistics  and linear mixed-effects model were used to assess the intervention effect after adjusting for potential confounders.
RESULTS


After the intervention, the prevalence of undernutrition was 16.7% lower in the intervention group compared with the control arm (30.6% Vs 47.3%, P = < 0.001). Women in the intervention group showed significant improvement in nutritional status at the end of the trial than the control group (β = 0.615, p = < 0.001).
CONCLUSION


This study demonstrated that guided counseling using the health belief model and the theory of planned behavior was effective in improving the nutritional status of pregnant women.

The preservation of fertility and integrity of the reproductive organs has increasingly been of concern to most women with adenomyosis. Adenomyomectomy is conservative surgery that is now widely applied; however, relapse is a serious problem after the operation. Postoperative treatment, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) has been suggested to result in reducing the rate of disease recurrence. However, there is still a lack of evidence from randomized clinical trials examining the efficacy of GnRHa in decreasing the postoperative recurrence rate.
METHOD/DESIGN


Relapse after conservative surgery combined with triptorelin acetate versus conservative surgery only in women with focal adenomyosis is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome is relapse assessed using a visual analogue scale (VRS) and numeric rating scale (NRS), pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) score, and the size of the uterus and the lesion as measured by two/three-dimensional color doppler ultrasonography (2D/3D-CDUS) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The secondary outcomes include quality of life, clinical pregnancy, ovarian reserve, adverse events, assessment by the Short Form (36) Health Survey and Female Sexual Function index, serum follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol levels, and anti-Muellerian hormone and so on. All these indexes are measured at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months after conservative surgery.
DISCUSSION

363,32345452,Effectiveness of suboccipital muscle inhibition combined with interferential current in patients with chronic tension-type headache: a randomised controlled clinical trial.,"INTRODUCTION


Manual therapy has been shown to reduce self-reported symptoms in patients with chronic tension-type headache (CTTH). However, simultaneous application of suboccipital muscle inhibition and interferential current has not previously been investigated. This study evaluates the effectiveness of combined treatment with suboccipital muscle inhibition and interferential current compared to standard treatment for pain, disability, and headache impact in patients with CTTH.
METHODS


Patients were randomly allocated to receive either standard treatment (n = 13) or the experimental treatment (n = 12), consisting of 20 minutes of suboccipital muscle inhibition plus interferential current twice weekly for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was improvement in pain, and secondary outcomes included improvement in headache-related disability and reduction in headache impact, which were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks by a blinded rater.
RESULTS


Statistical analysis showed improvements in the experimental treatment group at 4 weeks for headache-related disability (Neck Disability Index: Hedges' g = 1.01, P = .001; and Headache Disability Inventory: Hedges' g = 0.48, P = .022) and headache impact (6-item Headache Impact Test: Hedges' g = 0.15, P = .037) but not for self-reported pain (numerical rating scale: Hedges' g = 1.13, P = .18).
CONCLUSIONS


Combined treatment with suboccipital muscle inhibition and interferential current in patients with CTTH did not significantly improve self-reported pain but did reduce disability and the impact of headache on daily life at 4 weeks. These improvements exceed the minimum clinically important difference, demonstrating the clinical relevance of our findings.",2020,"RESULTS

364,32345476,[Effect of adding fortifiers and protein supplements on the osmolality of donated maternal milk].,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES


The fortification of maternal milk (MM) is a standard practice in order to achieve the requirements needed for the growth and development of the premature newborn. However, its osmolality could increase. According to the American Paediatrics Academy, it is recommended not to exceed 450 mOsm/kg (approximately 400 mOsm/L) in the diet of the infant, even though the safety limit is estimated to be between 400 and 600 mOsm/kg. The aim of this study is to determine the osmolality of thawed and fortified donated MM (DMM).
METHOD


An analysis was performed on DMM of 6 healthy mothers, without fortifying, and with 4 levels of fortification. Measurement of the samples was carried out in triplicate at 0, 4, 9, and 24hours after their preparation. They were stored refrigerated (2-8°C) between measurements. The study groups were: (A) Non-fortified DMM; (B) DMM with vitamins added; (C) with the addition of a fortifier; (D) with the addition of a low-dose protein formula; and (E) with the addition of a high-dose protein formula. The osmolality determinations were carried out using a freezing-point osmometer. The data analysis was performed using R software (v.3.5.1).
RESULTS


A total of 30 samples were analysed with 360 measurements. The osmolality of the DMM at t=0h was 301 mOsm/kg (SD 5.2) and slightly increased with time to 308.11 mOsm/kg (SD 5.21) after 24hours (t=24h), being maintained within the safety limits. The addition of vitamins (Group B) did not significantly increase the osmolality. The addition of a fortifier (C) and a low dose (D) or high dose (E) protein formula produced an increase in the baseline osmolality that increased statistically significantly in time (P=.007), but with no differences between the C, D, and E types. There were differences between the osmolality at t=0 with the fortification according to the manufacturer's data sheet (339 mOsm/l) and the findings in our laboratory (432.33 mOsm/l).
CONCLUSION


The osmolality values found in the thawed DMM samples were similar to those of other studies. The fortification of the DMM samples and their storage refrigerated at 2-8°C for 24h increased the osmolality, but keeping them within the safety limits.",2020,"There were differences between the osmolality at t=0 with the fortification according to the manufacturer's data sheet (339 mOsm/l) and the findings in our laboratory (432.33 mOsm/l).

365,32351205,"Efficacy and safety of esmirtazapine in adult outpatients with chronic primary insomnia: a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study, and open-label extension.","STUDY OBJECTIVES


Esmirtazapine (1.5-4.5 mg) has demonstrated short-term sleep-promoting effects in non-elderly outpatients with chronic insomnia. This Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study (NCT00631657) and its open-label extension (NCT00750919) investigated efficacy and safety of long-term esmirtazapine treatment in adult outpatients with chronic insomnia.
METHODS


Participants were randomized to receive esmirtazapine 4.5 mg or placebo for 6 months; those receiving esmirtazapine were then re-randomized to esmirtazapine or placebo for an additional 7 days. Participants could enter the 6-month open-label extension with esmirtazapine 4.5 mg. The primary objective of the double-blind study was to assess long-term efficacy of esmirtazapine versus placebo on self-reported total sleep time. Assessing long-term safety and tolerability were secondary and primary objectives of the double-blind and extension studies, respectively.
RESULTS


Overall, 457 participants received treatment in the double-blind study (esmirtazapine, n=342; placebo, n=115) and 184 participants (prior esmirtazapine, n=136; prior placebo, n=48) received esmirtazapine in the extension. In the double-blind study, a 48.7-min increase in average nightly total sleep time was observed for esmirtazapine versus placebo (95% confidence interval 35.0, 62.5; P<.0001) at Months 4-6. There was no evidence of residual effects on next-day alertness or daytime functioning, and no evidence of rebound insomnia or withdrawal symptoms upon treatment discontinuation. Esmirtazapine was generally well tolerated; somnolence and weight gain were the most common adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS


Esmirtazapine improved sleep duration versus placebo over at least 6 months. There was no evidence of next-day residual effects, or of withdrawal symptoms or rebound insomnia following abrupt treatment discontinuation.

There are beneficial effects of advanced carbohydrate counting with an automatic bolus calculator (ABC) and intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM) in persons with type 1 diabetes. We aim to compare the effects of isCGM, training in carbohydrate counting with ABC and the combination of the two concepts with standard care.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS


A multi-centre randomised controlled trial with inclusion criteria: ≥18 years, type 1 diabetes ≥1 year, injection therapy, HbA1c >53 mmol/mol, whereas daily use of carbohydrate counting and/or CGM/isCGM wear are exclusion criteria. Inclusion was initiated in October 2018 and is ongoing. Eligible persons are randomised into four groups: standard care, ABC, isCGM or ABC+isCGM. Devices used are FreeStyle Libre Flash and smart phone diabetes application mySugr. Participants attend group courses according to treatment allocation with different educational contents. Participants are followed for 26 weeks with clinical visits and telephone consultations. At baseline and at study end, participants wear blinded CGM, have blood samples performed and fill in questionnaires on person-related outcomes, and at baseline also on personality traits and hypoglycaemia awareness. The primary outcome is the difference in time spent in normoglycaemia (4-10 mmol/L) at study end versus baseline between the isCGM group and the standard care group. Secondary outcomes will also be analysed. Results are expected in 2020.

367,32345700,Investigating the effect of clinical pharmacist intervention in transitions of care on drug-related hospital readmissions among the elderly: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,"INTRODUCTION


Drug-related problems (DRPs) are a major cause of unplanned hospital admissions among elderly people, and transitions of care have been emphasised as a key area for improving patient safety. We have designed a complex clinical pharmacist intervention that targets people ≥75 years of age undergoing transitions of care from hospital to home and primary care. The main objective is to investigate if the intervention can reduce the risk of unplanned drug-related readmission within the first 180 days after the person is discharged from hospital.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS


This is a randomised, controlled, superiority trial with two parallel arms. A total of 700 people ≥75 years will be assigned to either intervention or routine care (control). The intervention, which aims to find and manage DRPs, is initiated within a week of the person being discharged from hospital and combines repeated medical chart reviews, phone interviews and in some cases medication reviews. People in both study arms may have been the subject of a medication review during their ward stay. As the primary outcome, we will measure time until unplanned drug-related readmission within 180 days of leaving hospital and use log rank tests and Cox proportional hazard models to analyse differences between the groups. Further investigations of subgroup effects and adjustments of the regression models will be based on heart failure and cognitive impairment as prognostic factors.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION


The study has been approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Umeå (registration numbers 2017-69-31M, 2018-83-32M and 2018-254-32M). We intend to publish the results with open access in international peer-reviewed journals and present our findings at international conferences. The trial is expected to result in more than one published article and form part of two PhD theses.

368,32345707,A novel decision aid to help plan for serious illness: a multisite randomized trial.,"BACKGROUND


Recent studies have shown substantial deficiencies in the quality or quantity (or both) of communication and decision-making during serious illness. We evaluated the efficacy of a novel decision support intervention, the Plan Well Guide, in increasing completion of a standard medical order form for advance medical care planning and improving decisional outcomes in nonacademic primary care settings.
METHODS


We conducted a randomized trial in 3 primary care practices in Lethbridge, Alberta in 2017-2018. We recruited ""patients at high risk"" referred by the primary care doctor who required establishment or review of their Goals of Care Designation (GCD). Enrolled patients were randomly allocated to receive the Plan Well Guide, delivered by a trained facilitator, or usual care. Eight to 12 weeks after the intervention, a research assistant blinded to intervention assignment contacted the patients in both groups by telephone to do a final outcome assessment. The primary outcome was completion of GCD forms; secondary outcomes included decisional conflict scores and ratings of satisfaction.
RESULTS


A total of 123 patients (59 women [48.0%]; mean age 73.9 yr) were enrolled, 66 in the intervention arm and 57 in the usualcare arm; 119 patients completed the trial. After the intervention, GCD completion rates in the intervention and usual-care groups were 95.3% and 90.9%, respectively (risk difference [RD] 4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -14% to 22%), and the rate of concordance between medical orders and expressed preferences on follow-up was 78% and 66%, respectively (RD 12%, 95% CI -7% to 30%). Significantly fewer patients in the intervention group than in the usual-care group had written medical orders for intensive care unit care and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (22 [34%] v. 33 [60%], RD -26%, 95% CI -42% to -8%). Patients in the intervention group had lower decisional conflict scores than those in the usual-care group (mean 30.9 v. 43.1, adjusted mean difference -12.0, 95% CI -23.2 to -0.8). Physicians considered patients in the intervention group to have lower decisional conflict than those in the usual-care group, although not significantly so (mean score 10.4 v. 14.9, adjusted mean difference -4.7, 95% CI -9.9 to 0.4) and spent less time with the former (mean 9.7 v. 13.2 min, adjusted mean difference -3.5, 95% CI -5.5 to -1.5 min).
INTERPRETATION


The decision-support intervention did not increase GCD completion rates but did seem to improve some aspects of decisional quality while reducing the physician's time to accomplish GCD decisions.

369,32345747,Kidney Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Change in eGFR in Individuals with CKD.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES


Kidney functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires further investigation to enhance the noninvasive identification of patients at high risk of CKD progression.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS


In this exploratory study, we obtained baseline diffusion-weighted and blood oxygen level-dependent MRI in 122 participants of the CKD Optimal Management with Binders and Nicotinamide trial, which was a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, 12-month, four-group parallel trial of nicotinamide and lanthanum carbonate versus placebo conducted in individuals with eGFR 20-45 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 . Lower values of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on diffusion-weighted MRI may indicate increased fibrosis, and higher values of relaxation rate (R2*) on blood oxygen level-dependent MRI may represent decreased oxygenation. Because there was no effect of active treatment on eGFR over 12 months, we tested whether baseline kidney functional MRI biomarkers were associated with eGFR decline in all 122 participants. In a subset of 87 participants with 12-month follow-up MRI data, we evaluated whether kidney functional MRI biomarkers change over time.
RESULTS


Mean baseline eGFR was 32±9 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 , and mean annual eGFR slope was -2.3 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], -3.4 to -1.1) ml/min per 1.73 m 2  per year. After adjustment for baseline covariates, baseline ADC was associated with change in eGFR over time (difference in annual eGFR slope per 1 SD increase in ADC: 1.3 [95% CI, 0.1 to 2.5] ml/min per 1.73 m 2  per year, ADC×time interaction  P =0.04). This association was no longer significant after further adjustment for albuminuria (difference in annual eGFR slope per 1 SD increase in ADC: 1.0 (95% CI, -0.1 to 2.2) ml/min per 1.73 m 2  per year, ADC×time interaction  P =0.08). There was no significant association between baseline R2* and change in eGFR over time. In 87 participants with follow-up functional MRI, ADC and R2* values remained stable over 12 months (intraclass correlation: 0.71 and 0.68, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS


Baseline cortical ADC was associated with change in eGFR over time, but this association was not independent of albuminuria. Kidney functional MRI biomarkers remained stable over 1 year.

370,32345760,Esophageal Pressure Versus Gas Exchange to Set PEEP During Intraoperative Ventilation.,"BACKGROUND


Pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg position affect respiratory system mechanics and oxygenation during elective pelvic robotic surgery. The primary aim of this randomized pilot study was to compare the effects of a conventional low tidal volume ventilation with PEEP guided by gas exchange (V Gas-guided ) versus low tidal volume ventilation tailoring PEEP according to esophageal pressure (V Pes-guided ) on oxygenation and respiratory mechanics during elective pelvic robotic surgery.
METHODS


This study was conducted in a single-center tertiary hospital between September 2017 and January 2019. Forty-nine adult patients scheduled for elective pelvic robotic surgery were screened; 28 subjects completed the full analysis. Exclusion criteria were American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status ≥ 3, contraindications to nasogastric catheter placement, and pregnancy. After dedicated naso/orogastric catheter insertion, subjects were randomly assigned to V Gas-guided  ([Formula: see text] and PEEP set to achieve [Formula: see text] > 94%) or V Pes-guided  (PEEP tailored to equalize end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure). Oxygenation ([Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text]) was evaluated (1) at randomization, after pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg application; (2) at 60 min; (3) at 120 min following randomization; and (4) at end of surgery. Respiratory mechanics were assessed during the duration of the study.
RESULTS


Compared to V Gas-guided , oxygenation was higher with V Pes-guided  at 60 min (388 ± 90 vs 308 ± 95 mm Hg,  P  = .02), at 120 min after randomization (400 ± 90 vs 308 ± 81 mm Hg,  P  = .008), and at the end of surgery (402 ± 95 vs 312 ± 95 mm Hg,  P  = .009). Respiratory system elastance was lower with V Pes-guided  compared to V Gas-guided  at 20 min (24.2 ± 7.3 vs 33.4 ± 10.7 cm H 2 O/L,  P  = .001) and 60 min (24.1 ± 5.4 vs 31.9 ± 8.5 cm H 2 O/L,  P  = .006) from randomization.
CONCLUSIONS


Oxygenation and respiratory system mechanics were improved when applying a ventilatory strategy tailoring PEEP to equalize expiratory transpulmonary pressure in subjects undergoing pelvic robotic surgery compared to a V Gas-guided  approach.

371,32345787,Treatment for vaginal atrophy using microablative fractional CO2 laser: a randomized double-blinded sham-controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE


The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of vaginal CO2 laser for the treatment of vaginal atrophy compared to the sham procedure.
METHODS


Between June 2016 and May 2017, postmenopausal women with moderate to severe intensity of any vaginal atrophy symptoms (VAS) were invited to participate in the study. A total of 88 women were randomized to receive treatment with either vaginal CO2 laser or sham procedures every 4 weeks for three sessions. Both the participants and the evaluators were blinded to the treatment. Vaginal Health Index (VHI) score (primary outcome), VAS score, and the item for vaginal dryness from the International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire-Vaginal Symptoms questionnaire were compared between the two groups by intention-to-treat analysis at 12 weeks after treatment.
RESULTS


Eighty-eight women were enrolled into the study and nine women were lost to follow-up. After 12 weeks of laser treatment, the VHI, VAS, and International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire-Vaginal Symptoms (item for vaginal dryness) scores were significantly improved. For VHI and VAS scores the mean difference between the laser group versus the sham group was 1.37 (95% CI: 0.12-2.63), P < 0.001 and -1.52 (95% CI: -2.21 to -0.82), P = 0.03, respectively.

372,32345788,The Women's Health Initiative trials of menopausal hormone therapy: lessons learned.,"OBJECTIVE


The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) assessed oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) taken with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) for prevention of chronic disease in postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years.
METHODS


Women with an intact uterus (n = 16,608) were randomized to CEE+ MPA therapy or placebo for a median of 5.6 years; women with hysterectomy (n = 10,739) were randomized to CEE-alone therapy or placebo for a median of 7.2 years. Both cohorts have been followed for 18 years.
RESULTS


In the overall study population (mean age, 63 y), neither estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT) nor estrogen-only therapy prevented coronary heart disease or led to a favorable balance of chronic-disease benefits and risks. Subgroup analyses, however, suggest that timing of hormone therapy (HT) initiation influences the relation between HT and coronary risk, as well as its overall benefit-risk balance, with more favorable effects in women who are younger (age < 60 year) or recently menopausal (within 10 year) than in women who are older or further past the menopausal transition. In younger women who entered the trial of estrogen-only therapy with oophorectomy, the intervention was associated with a significant 32% reduction in all-cause mortality over long-term follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS


WHI findings indicate important differences in HT-related clinical outcomes by age and time since menopause. Systemic HT has an acceptable safety profile for menopause management when initiated among healthy women who are younger (or recently menopausal) and not at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease or breast cancer. Initiation of treatment in older women who are distant from menopause onset, however, should be avoided.

373,32346244,Can Low-Level Laser and Light-Emitting Diode Enhance the Stability of Dental Implants?,"Purpose


Stability of dental implants is an important factor for evaluation of osseointegration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of combined use of low-level laser (LLL) and light-emitting diode (LED) therapy on the stability of dental implants during the healing phase.
Materials and Methods


This was a randomized clinical trial. Patients were assigned to two groups: In group 1, patients received LLL and LED 20 min/day for 10 days after implant insertion. Patients in group 2 (controls) did not undergo LLL and LED. The implant stability quotient (ISQ) was measured at 0 (time 0), 10 (time 1), 21 (time 2), 42 (time 3) and 63 days (time 4) after implant placement. Independent  t  test was used to compare the ISQs between the two groups.
Results


Fifty-eight patients were studied in two groups ( n  = 28). The mean ISQ did not differ immediately after insertion ( P  > 0.05). The mean ISQ differed significantly between the two groups on days 10, 21, 42 and 63 ( P  < 0.05). Results demonstrated an increase in the amount of ISQ in group 1 (intervention) at times 1, 2, 3 and 4. In the control group, the amount of ISQ decreased on days 10 and 21 following implant insertion, but increased afterward on days 42 and 63.

374,31819201,Hypoxia and exercise interactions on skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in obese subjects with metabolic syndrome: results of a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND


Physical activity improves insulin sensitivity in obesity. Hypoxia training is claimed to augment this effect. We tested the hypothesis that normobaric hypoxia training would improve insulin sensitivity in obese patients with metabolic syndrome.
METHODS


In a randomized controlled trial, 23 obese men with metabolic syndrome who were not informed of the FiO 2  conditions underwent a 6-week physical exercise intervention under ambient (n = 11; FiO 2  21%) conditions or hypoxia (n = 12; FiO 2  15%) using a normobaric hypoxic chamber. Three 60-min sessions of interval training were performed each week at 60% of individual V̇O 2max . Assessment of myocellular insulin sensitivity by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp was performed in 21 of these subjects before and after 6 weeks of training. Comprehensive phenotyping also included biopsies of subcutaneous adipose tissues.
RESULTS


The intermittent moderate physical exercise protocol did not substantially change the myocellular insulin sensitivity within 6 weeks under normoxic conditions (ISI Clamp : 0.035 (IQR 0.016-0.075) vs. 0.037 (IQR 0.026-0.056) mg* kg -1  *min -1 /(mU* l -1 ); p = 0.767). In contrast, ISI Clamp  improved during hypoxia training (0.028 (IQR 0.018-0.035) vs. 0.038 (IQR 0.024-0.060) mg * kg -1  *min -1 /(mU *l -1 ); p < 0.05). Between group comparison of ISI Clamp  change revealed a small difference between groups (Cohen's d = 0.26). Within the hypoxic group, improvement of ISI Clamp  during training was associated with individual increase of circulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels (r = 0.678, p = 0.015), even if mean VEGF levels were not modified by any training condition. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) system components were not associated with increased ISI Clamp  during hypoxic training.
CONCLUSIONS

375,30232416,Ghrelin is impacted by the endogenous circadian system and by circadian misalignment in humans.,"The human circadian system regulates hunger independently of behavioral factors, resulting in a trough in the biological morning and a peak in the biological evening. However, the role of the only known orexigenic hormone, ghrelin, in this circadian rhythm is unknown. Furthermore, although shift work is an obesity risk factor, the separate effects of the endogenous circadian system, the behavioral cycle, and circadian misalignment on ghrelin has not been systematically studied. Here we show-by using two 8-day laboratory protocols-that circulating active (acylated) ghrelin levels are significantly impacted by endogenous circadian phase in healthy adults. Active ghrelin levels were higher in the biological evening than the biological morning (fasting +15.1%, P = 0.0001; postprandial +10.4%, P = 0.0002), consistent with the circadian variation in hunger (P = 0.028). Moreover, circadian misalignment itself (12-h behavioral cycle inversion) increased postprandial active ghrelin levels (+5.4%; P = 0.04). While not significantly influencing hunger (P > 0.08), circadian misalignment increased appetite for energy-dense foods (all P < 0.05).

376,30900607,Determination of the optimal volume of ascitic fluid for the precise diagnosis of malignant ascites.,"Background/Aims


The aim of this study was to determine the optimal volume of peritoneal effusion required to diagnose malignant ascites.
Patients and Methods


The authors recruited 123 patients with shifting dullness and obtained 123 peritoneocentesis fluid samples. The samples were divided into seven aliquots of 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 mL for cytopathological examination. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated for each aliquot.
Results


The sensitivity for the diagnosis of malignant ascites gradually increased as the sample volume increased and reached a constant value at a volume of 200 mL. The sensitivity and NPV for the 10-, 100-, and 150-mL volumes were significantly different from those for the 200-mL sample. However, the sensitivity and NPV for the 250- and 300-mL volumes were not significantly different. The sensitivity for the diagnosis of malignant ascites is closely related to the volume of peritoneal fluid that is extracted by peritoneocentesis.

We suggest a volume of 200 mL as the optimal minimum volume to confirm malignant ascites in patients with shifting dullness.",2019,"However, the sensitivity and NPV for the 250- and 300-mL volumes were not significantly different.","['patients with shifting dullness', '123 patients with shifting dullness and obtained 123 peritoneocentesis fluid samples']",[],"['sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV', 'sensitivity and NPV']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0277979', 'cui_str': 'Shifting abdominal dullness'}, {'cui': 'C1301820', 'cui_str': 'Obtained'}, {'cui': 'C0198497', 'cui_str': 'Abdominal paracentesis'}, {'cui': 'C0438734', 'cui_str': 'Fluid sample'}]",[],"[{'cui': 'C0020517', 'cui_str': 'Hypersensitivity reaction'}, {'cui': 'C0037791', 'cui_str': 'Specificity'}, {'cui': 'C0205160', 'cui_str': 'Negative'}, {'cui': 'C1273875', 'cui_str': 'Values (community)'}, {'cui': 'C1446409', 'cui_str': 'Positive'}]",123.0,0.062564,"However, the sensitivity and NPV for the 250- and 300-mL volumes were not significantly different.","[{'ForeName': 'Feifei', 'Initials': 'F', 'LastName': 'Zhang', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Zhenning', 'Initials': 'Z', 'LastName': 'Feng', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Yichi', 'Initials': 'Y', 'LastName': 'Zhang', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Zishuai', 'Initials': 'Z', 'LastName': 'Liu', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Xiaoli', 'Initials': 'X', 'LastName': 'Sun', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Shizhu', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Jin', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150086, China.'}]",Saudi journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Saudi Gastroenterology Association,['10.4103/sjg.SJG_547_18']
377,30932252,Respiratory polygraphy in children with sleep-disordered breathing.,"At-home respiratory polygraphy has been shown to be a reliable substitute for in-laboratory polysomnography in adults for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea, but this is less well studied in children. One aim of this study was to examine the quality of at-home respiratory polygraphy in children with sleep-disordered breathing and to evaluate the interrater reliability of the results. Another aim was to study whether calibrated respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) flow can be used for the scoring of respiratory events when the airflow measurements are unreliable. Children aged 4-10 years, with sleep-disordered breathing, underwent at-home respiratory polygraphy. Of 113 polygraphies, only 46% were of acceptable quality, with missing nasal airflow being the most common problem (40%). The median recorded time with artifact-free signal present in three traces simultaneously was 228 min (0-610 min). Seventeen polygraphy studies were selected for further study. Each study was scored by two independent scorers, with and without the nasal airflow signal present, the latter relying on RIP flow for the scoring of respiratory events. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) from the four different measurements was compared using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Comparison of the two scorers showed moderate agreement, with (ICC = 0.66) and without (ICC = 0.53) nasal airflow. One scorer had good agreement between AHI with and without nasal airflow (ICC = 0.81), whereas the other had poor agreement (ICC = 0.12). In conclusion, the scoring of respiratory events based on RIP flow is scorer dependent even for experienced scorers. The nasal airflow signal is frequently missing in paediatric respiratory polygraphies, which limits the usefulness of the method.",2019,"Of 113 polygraphies, only 46% were of acceptable quality, with missing nasal airflow being the most common problem (40%).","['Seventeen polygraphy studies were selected for further study', 'children with sleep-disordered breathing', 'Children aged 4-10\xa0years, with sleep-disordered breathing, underwent at-home respiratory polygraphy']",['calibrated respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) flow'],['apnea-hypopnea index (AHI'],"[{'cui': 'C0450331', 'cui_str': '17'}, {'cui': 'C0008972', 'cui_str': 'Clinical Study'}, {'cui': 'C0008059', 'cui_str': 'Child'}, {'cui': 'C0037313', 'cui_str': 'Sleep'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0442519', 'cui_str': 'Domestic'}]","[{'cui': 'C0032221', 'cui_str': 'Plethysmography'}]","[{'cui': 'C2111846', 'cui_str': 'Apnea Hypopnea Index'}]",,0.01406,"Of 113 polygraphies, only 46% were of acceptable quality, with missing nasal airflow being the most common problem (40%).","[{'ForeName': 'Gunnhildur', 'Initials': 'G', 'LastName': 'Gudnadottir', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'ForeName': 'Louise', 'Initials': 'L', 'LastName': 'Hafsten', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}, {'ForeName': 'Staffan', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Redfors', 'Affiliation': ""Queen Silvia's Children's Hospital at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.""}, {'ForeName': 'Eva', 'Initials': 'E', 'LastName': 'Ellegård', 'Affiliation': ""Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Halland's Hospital, Kungsbacka, Sweden.""}, {'ForeName': 'Johan', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Hellgren', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.'}]",Journal of sleep research,['10.1111/jsr.12856']
378,32346274,HIV Prevention Programming for Older African American Women: The Impact of a Faith-Based and Behavioral Science Partnership on Depressive Symptoms.,"Objective


The current study sought to test the effect of an HIV prevention intervention on depressive symptoms in a sample of older African American women.
Design Setting and Participants


A pretest-posttest randomized control group design was conducted in a mega-church in Los Angeles with a sample of 62 older African American women, aged ≥50 years, 29 of whom were randomly assigned to the experimental condition and 33 to the comparison/control condition.
Measures


A measure of psychological wellbeing (CES-D) was utilized to test the effect of the four-session group intervention vs the one-session informational group intervention on change in depressive symptoms from pretest to posttest. Demographic characteristics included: measures of age in years; relationship and employment statuses (coded 1 for yes, 0 for no); and educational attainment.
Results


Participation in the study was associated with a significant improvement in the women's psychological wellbeing from baseline to time 2; ie, decreased depressive symptoms. This change was greater for women in the four-session experimental group than for those in the one-session comparison group, due in part to a marginally significant interaction between time and experimental conditions.
Conclusions

379,32346488,Does walking the day of total hip arthroplasty speed up functional independence? A non-randomized controlled study.,"Background


Few data address modalities for speeding up functional independence in subjects included in a fast-track approach after total hip arthroplasty (THA). The study aim was to assess short-term effects of mobilization and walking the day of THA (WDS) on independence, pain, function and quality of life.
Methods


Seventy-one patients were allocated in a study (SG:  n  = 36) or control (CG:  n  = 35) groups according to time of surgery and recovery from anesthesia. Patients who recovered lower limbs sensitivity (disappearance of sensation deficits) and motility (MRC scale ≥3 at knee, ankle and great toe extension) by 7.00 p.m. made up the SG, whereas patients who underwent surgery later and recovered from anesthesia after 7.00 p.m. made up the CG. SG underwent WDS, whereas CG performed mobilization and walking the day after surgery starting the same physiotherapy program 1 day later. Patients were evaluated for independence (Functional Independence Measure - FIM), pain (Numeric Rating Scale - NRS), hip function (Harris Hip Score - HHS) and quality of life (EuroQoL-5Dimension - EQ. 5D and EQ. 5D-VAS)the day before surgery, at 3 and 7 days in a hospital setting. Analysis of Covariance with age (SG: mean 60.9, SD 9.0; CG: mean 65.5, SD 8.9) and BMI (SG: mean 27.4, SD 2.8; CG: mean 26.7, SD 2.4) as covariates was used to assess between-group differences over time.
Results


Between-groups differences were observed for FIM total and motor scores ( p  = 0.002, mean difference: 2.1, CI 95 : 0.64, 3.7) and FIM self-care ( p  = 0.01, mean difference: 1.7, CI 95 : 0.41, 3) in favor of SG at 3 days. Between-group differences were found for FIM self-care ( p  = 0.021, mean difference: 1.2, CI 95 : 0.18, 2.1) in favor of SG at 7 days. FIM total and motor scores ( p  <  0.001), FIM self-care ( p  = 0.027) and transfer-locomotion (p <  0.001) and HHS ( p  = 0.032) decreased after surgery followed by improvements in postoperative days ( p  ≤ 0.001). No differences were found for NRS, EQ. 5D and EQ. 5D-VAS.
Conclusions


WDS produces additional benefits in patients' independence in the first week after THA.

Material and Methods:  Patients treated to 78 Gy in 2 Gy fractions ( n  = 298) or 64.6 Gy in 3.4 Gy fractions ( n  = 295) with available late toxicity questionnaires ( n  ≥ 2 within 1-5 years post-treatment) and available 3D planning data were eligible for this study. The majority received intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). We calculated two types of dose surface maps: (1) the total delineated rectum with its central axis scaled to unity, and (2) the delineated rectum with a length of 7 cm along its central axis aligned on the prostate's half-height point (prostate-half). For each patient-reported GI symptom, dose difference maps were constructed by subtracting average co-registered EQD2 (equivalent dose in 2 Gy) dose maps of patients with and without the symptom of interest, separately for HF and CF.  P -values were derived from permutation tests. We evaluated patient-reported moderate to severe GI symptoms.  Results:  Observed incidences of rectal bleeding and increased stool frequency were significantly higher in the HF group. For rectal bleeding ( p  = 0.016), mucus discharge ( p  = 0.015), and fecal incontinence ( p  = 0.001), significant local dose-effects were observed in HF patients but not in CF patients. For rectal pain, similar local dose-effects ( p  < 0.05) were observed in both groups. No significant local dose-effects were observed for increased stool frequency. Total rectum mapping vs. prostate-half mapping showed similar results.  Conclusion:  We demonstrated significant local dose-effect relationships for patient-reported late GI toxicity in patients treated with modern RT. HF patients were at higher risk for increased stool frequency and rectal bleeding, and showed the most pronounced local dose-effects in intermediate-high dose regions. These findings suggest that improvement of current treatment optimization protocols could lead to clinical benefit, in particular for HF treatment.",2020,"HF patients were at higher risk for increased stool frequency and rectal bleeding, and showed the most pronounced local dose-effects in intermediate-high dose regions.","['patients treated with modern RT', 'Patients treated to 78 Gy in 2 Gy fractions ( n  = 298) or 64.6 Gy in 3.4 Gy fractions ( n  = 295) with available late toxicity questionnaires ( n  ≥ 2 within 1-5 years post-treatment) and available 3D planning data were eligible for this study']","['conventionally fractionated (CF) and hypofractionated (HF) modern radiotherapy', 'Hypofractionated and Conventionally Fractionated Modern Radiotherapy', 'intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT']","['local dose-effects', 'rectal bleeding and increased stool frequency', 'stool frequency and rectal bleeding', 'stool frequency', 'mucus discharge', 'rectal bleeding', 'fecal incontinence', 'Late Gastrointestinal Toxicity', 'gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities', 'late GI toxicity']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0332293', 'cui_str': 'Treated with'}, {'cui': 'C0087111', 'cui_str': 'Therapeutic procedure'}, {'cui': 'C1264633', 'cui_str': 'Fraction of'}, {'cui': 'C4517692', 'cui_str': '3.4'}, {'cui': 'C0470187', 'cui_str': 'Availability of'}, {'cui': 'C0205087', 'cui_str': 'Late'}, {'cui': 'C0040539', 'cui_str': 'TO'}, {'cui': 'C0034394', 'cui_str': 'Questionnaires'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0687676', 'cui_str': 'After values'}, {'cui': 'C0039798', 'cui_str': 'therapy'}, {'cui': 'C0032074', 'cui_str': 'Cognitive function: planning'}, {'cui': 'C0008972', 'cui_str': 'Clinical Study'}]","[{'cui': 'C0034619', 'cui_str': 'radiotherapy'}, {'cui': 'C0522510', 'cui_str': 'With intensity'}, {'cui': 'C0443264', 'cui_str': 'Modulated'}, {'cui': 'C1512814', 'cui_str': 'Intensity modulated radiation therapy'}]","[{'cui': 'C0205276', 'cui_str': 'Local'}, {'cui': 'C0178602', 'cui_str': 'Dosage'}, {'cui': 'C1280500', 'cui_str': 'Effect'}, {'cui': 'C0018932', 'cui_str': 'Hematochezia'}, {'cui': 'C0239978', 'cui_str': 'Increased frequency of defecation'}, {'cui': 'C0015733', 'cui_str': 'Feces'}, {'cui': 'C0237630', 'cui_str': 'Stimulus frequency'}, {'cui': 'C0333273', 'cui_str': 'Mucus discharge'}, {'cui': 'C0015732', 'cui_str': 'Incontinence of feces'}, {'cui': 'C0205087', 'cui_str': 'Late'}, {'cui': 'C1142499', 'cui_str': 'Gastrointestinal toxicity'}, {'cui': 'C0040539', 'cui_str': 'TO'}]",,0.08856,"HF patients were at higher risk for increased stool frequency and rectal bleeding, and showed the most pronounced local dose-effects in intermediate-high dose regions.","[{'ForeName': 'Wilma D', 'Initials': 'WD', 'LastName': 'Heemsbergen', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands.'}, {'ForeName': 'Luca', 'Initials': 'L', 'LastName': 'Incrocci', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands.'}, {'ForeName': 'Floris J', 'Initials': 'FJ', 'LastName': 'Pos', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands.'}, {'ForeName': 'Ben J M', 'Initials': 'BJM', 'LastName': 'Heijmen', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands.'}, {'ForeName': 'Marnix G', 'Initials': 'MG', 'LastName': 'Witte', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands.'}]",Frontiers in oncology,['10.3389/fonc.2020.00469']
381,32346543,Prediction of median survival time in sepsis patients by the SOFA score combined with different predictors.,"Background


Sepsis is the leading cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The purpose of this study was to explore the prognostic value of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, the Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and procalcitonin (PCT), albumin (ALB), and lactate (LAC) levels in patients with sepsis.
Methods


Consecutive adult patients with suspected or documented sepsis at ICU admission were recruited. Their basic vital signs and related auxiliary examinations to determine their PCT and ALB levels and APACHE II score were recorded at ICU admission, and their LAC levels and SOFA scores were recorded for one week after admission. The influence of these variables on hospital mortality was evaluated. Logistic regression was used to derive the Sepsis Hospital Mortality Score (SHMS), a prediction equation describing the relationship between predictors and hospital mortality. The median survival time was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. In the validation group, the kappa value was calculated to evaluate the stability of the derived formula.
Results


This study included 894 sepsis patients admitted to 18 ICUs in 16 tertiary hospitals. Patients were randomly assigned to an experimental group (626 cases) and validation group (258 cases). In addition, a nonsurvival group (248 patients) of the experimental group was established according to the outcome at the time of discharge. The hospital mortality rate in the experimental group was 39.6% (248/626). Univariate and multivariate regression analyses revealed that the APACHE II score (odds ratio [OR] = 1.178), △SOFA (OR = 1.186), △LAC (OR = 1.157), and SOFA mean score (OR = 1.086) were independently associated with hospital mortality. The SHMS was calculated as logit(p) = 4.715 - (0.164 × APACHE II) - (0.171 × △SOFA) - (0.145 × △LAC) - (0.082 × SOFA mean). A receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed to further investigate the accuracy of the SHMS, with an area under the curve of 0.851 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.821-0.882;  p  < 0.001) for hospital mortality. In the low-risk group and high-risk groups, the corresponding median survival times were 15 days and 11 days, respectively.
Conclusion


The APACHE II score, △SOFA, △LAC and SOFA mean score were independently associated with hospital mortality in sepsis patients and accurately predicted the hospital mortality rate and median survival time. Data on the median survival time in sepsis patients could be provided to clinicians to assist in the rational use of limited medical resources by facilitating prudent resource allocation.

Materials and Methods:  For this study, 120 patients with PAR were randomly assigned to SPG acupuncture, traditional acupuncture ( Yingxiang  [LI 20],  Hegu  [LI 4], and  Yintang  [Ex-HN 3]), or drug treatment (budesonide nasal spray). Efficacy was assessed by using single symptoms, including sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction and nasal itch, a total nasal symptoms score (TNSS), and a Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) before treatment, the day treatment ended, and 4-, 8-, 12-weeks later, respectively.  Results:  Four weeks after treatment ended, the effectiveness rate in the SPG-acupuncture group was superior to that of the traditional-acupuncture group ( P  = 0.033) but was still lower than that of the drug-treatment group ( P  = 0.039), with mean effectiveness rates of 69.70%, 44.44%, and 71.43%, respectively. However, these rates gradually decreased in each group during weeks 8 through 16. Moreover, statistically significant improvements in TNSS', and reductions in nasal congestion and sneezing symptoms were observed in the SPG-acupuncture group, compared with those in the traditional-acupuncture group as early as the day treatment ended and this continued throughout the observation period ( P  < 0.05). However, the improvement did not continue for sneezing, during weeks 8 through weeks 12 after treatment ended. The RQLQ of the SPG-acupuncture group was lower than that of the traditional-acupuncture group at week 12; however, there were no differences at weeks 8 and 16.

384,32351664,Effects of Laser Acupuncture and Dietary Intervention on Key Obesity Parameters.,"Objectives:  The scope of obesity includes quality of life (QoL); emotions; and financial burdens on individuals, families, and society. Obesity contributes to many diseases, such as coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, osteoarthritis, and cancer. Dietary modifications, lifestyle interventions, pharmacologic agents, and surgical interventions are some ways to address obesity; yet, safer, more-effective options are needed. Laser acupuncture can significantly lower body mass index (BMI) by reducing abdominal and visceral adipose tissue content and regulating lipid metabolism. This study investigated the effects of laser acupuncture + diet modification on fasting blood-glucose level, insulin level, waist:hip ratio, QoL scoring, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level, triglycerides, BMI, and appetite scoring in obese patients.  Materials and Methods:  The patients ( N  = 38) were divided randomly into 2 groups: (1) laser acupuncture + dietary intervention ( n  = 19) and (2) sham laser acupuncture + dietary intervention ( n  = 19). Both groups had the same dietary intervention and laser acupuncture sessions, 3 times/week for 4 weeks. All parameters were assessed before and after the interventions.  Results:  There were statistically significant differences in waist:hip ratio ( P  = 0.000), QoL scores ( P  = 0.000), BMI ( P  = 0.000), and appetite scores ( P  = 0.000) between the 2 groups after the interventions. There were no differences in levels of blood glucose ( P  = 0.543), insulin ( P  = 1.00), HDL ( P  = 0.208), and triglycerides ( P  = 0.413) between the 2 groups after the interventions.

385,32351699,The effect of a sand surface on physical performance responses of junior male handball players to plyometric training.,"Background


The effects of 7 weeks plyometric training on a stable surface and on sand were compared in junior male handball players.
Methods


A team of experienced players was divided randomly between three groups, undertaking a standard in-season regimen (C,  n  = 10), or supplementing this regimen by plyometric training on sand (PS,  n  = 11) or a stable surface (P, n = 10) for 7 weeks. Assessments included 20 m sprint times, change of direction tests (Modified change-of-direction T-test and Modified Illinois test), a repeated sprint T-test, jumping ability (squat, countermovement and five jump tests), and static and dynamic balance.
Results


After the intervention, PS showed significant increases of sprint speed relative to P and C. Change of direction scores were also improved for PS relative to P and C. Both PS and P increased vertical jump performance (squat jump,  p  = 0.005; ES = 0.170; counter-movement jump  p  < 0.001; ES = 0.247). Repeated sprint T-test scores improved in PS and P relative to C, with best times of PS > P ( p  < 0.05). Both plyometric groups improved their dynamic balance (p < 0.05), with three parameters of PS and only one of P being significantly greater than C. Static balance was also enhanced in both experimental groups (PS > P).
Conclusions


We conclude that for reasons that remain to be clarified, several performance measures in adolescent male handball players were increased more by 7 weeks of PS than by P.",2020,"Repeated sprint T-test scores improved in PS and P relative to C, with best times of PS > P ( p  < 0.05).","['adolescent male handball players', 'junior male handball players to plyometric training', 'junior male handball players']","['sand surface', 'plyometric training', 'undertaking a standard in-season regimen (C,  n \u2009=\u200910), or supplementing this regimen by plyometric training on sand (PS,  n \u2009=\u200911) or a stable surface']","['physical performance responses', 'vertical jump performance', 'sprint speed relative to P and C.

386,32351727,Early versus Delayed Phacoemulsification and Intraocular Lens Implantation for Acute Primary Angle-Closure.,"Purpose


To compare the effects of early phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation (phaco/IOL), delayed phaco/IOL after initial laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI), and conventional LPI alone in patients with acute primary angle-closure (PAC).
Methods


Patients with acute PAC were included in the study, and those with secondary glaucoma, prior ocular trauma, or other ocular diseases and those who had undergone ocular surgeries previously were excluded. Patients were categorized into three groups: Group A, which underwent primary phaco/IOL after acute PAC; Group B, which underwent LPI initially after acute PAC, followed by phaco/IOL within 6 months; and Group C, which underwent LPI alone. The IOP control success at 12 months as well as changes in ocular characteristics and the number of antiglaucoma medications used after the treatment among the groups were evaluated.
Results


Eighty-one eyes were included in the study: 24 eyes in Group A, 23 eyes in Group B, and 34 eyes in Group C. The linear mixed model analysis demonstrated considerable IOP control in Groups A and B. Visual acuity, anterior chamber depth (ACD), and angle width improved significantly in Groups A and B, but not in Group C. The number of antiglaucoma medications used was significantly higher in Group C than in Groups A and B.
Conclusions


Patients who underwent phaco/IOL had better IOP control, improved vision, deeper ACD, and wider angle and required less antiglaucoma medications than those who underwent LPI alone.

387,32351995,Chinese Herbal Medicine Dingji Fumai Decoction for Ventricular Premature Contraction: A Real-World Trial.,"Background


Chinese herbal medicine Dingji Fumai Decoction (DFD) is widely clinically used for ventricular premature contraction (VPC). This real-word trial was designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of DFD for VPC.
Methods


This was a double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial. Patients with VPC were randomized (1 : 1) to treatment with DFD combined with metoprolol (DFD arm) or metoprolol combined with placebo (MET arm). A primary end point was a composite of clinical symptoms and signs determined by the traditionalChinese medicine syndrome score and the number of VPC determined by the Holter examination. Second outcomes were adverse events, medication compliance, and laboratory examination.
Results


144 patients were randomized to DFD arm (76 patients) or MET arm (68 patients), and 136 cases (71 in DFD arm and 65 in MET arm) finally completed this trial. After a 12-week follow-up, DFD arm significantly decreased traditional Chinese medicine syndrome score and the number of VPC compared with MET arm ( P  = 0.003 and 0.034, respectively). There was no adverse drug effect and patient medication compliance was good.

388,32352008,Effectiveness of Various Final Irrigation Techniques on Sealer Penetration in Curved Roots: A Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy Study.,"Objective


To compare the efficacy of various techniques used for final irrigation on sealer penetration in the apical one-third of curved root canals.  Material and Methods . Sixty-five freshly extracted maxillary first molar teeth with mesiobuccal roots having more than 20° of root curvature were used. The root canals were instrumented and randomly divided into four experimental groups and one control group. In the 4 experimental groups, 3 ml of 17% EDTA followed by 3 ml of 5.25% NaOCl was delivered with the use of the following protocols: Group 1: manual dynamic activation (MDA), Group 2: sonic irrigation (SI), Group 3: passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI), and Group 4: conventional needle irrigation (CI). All teeth were obturated with gutta-percha and AH Plus sealer labeled with fluorescent dye. Transverse sections at 2 mm and 4 mm distance from the root apex were examined with the aid of confocal laser scanning microscopy. Total percentage (%) and maximum depth ( μ m) of sealer penetration were measured.
Results


All the experimental groups exhibited significantly higher penetration rates than the control group at both sections ( p  < 0.05). However, no significant differences were found in the penetration depth and percentage among the four experimental groups evaluated at both sections ( p  > 0.05).

389,31519527,Factors that contribute to blood donation behavior among primary healthcare users: A structural approach.,"This study aimed to evaluate the relative contribution of psychosocial variables to donation behavior in a sample of primary healthcare users in a Brazilian municipality. Donor recruitment and retention continue to pose significant challenges to blood collection services worldwide and is especially important among low and middle income countries (LMICs), challenged with higher rates of stigma and low public awareness about donation. A cross-sectional study with randomized stratified sampling of 1055 primary healthcare users was conducted across 12 healthcare facilities in Ribeirão Preto, state of São Paulo. Participants completed measures assessing psychosocial variables, including religiosity, knowledge regarding blood donation process, overall quality of life, blood donation of peers, sociodemographic variables, and the fear of blood, injections, and fainting. The associations between psychosocial variables and donation behaviour was examined using structural equation modelling. Blood donation was more frequent in males and among individuals with higher socioeconomic and educational levels. The structural model indicated associations between blood donation behaviour and fear, knowledge, age, sex, socioeconomic status, and educational level. Fear of blood, injections and vasovagal reactions, and a lack of knowledge of the donation process were revealed as important barriers to the decision to donate blood. In addition, there is evidence that considering the population of primary healthcare users, the women, the youngers, and those with lower socioeconomic status and lower educational level are less likely to donate blood.",2019,"Participants completed measures assessing psychosocial variables, including religiosity, knowledge regarding blood donation process, overall quality of life, blood donation of peers, sociodemographic variables, and the fear of blood, injections, and fainting.","['primary healthcare users', '1055 primary healthcare users was conducted across 12 healthcare facilities in Ribeirão Preto, state of São Paulo', 'primary healthcare users in a Brazilian municipality']",[],"['psychosocial variables, including religiosity, knowledge regarding blood donation process, overall quality of life, blood donation of peers, sociodemographic variables, and the fear of blood, injections, and fainting', 'blood donation behaviour and fear, knowledge, age, sex, socioeconomic status, and educational level', 'Fear of blood, injections and vasovagal reactions', 'blood donation behavior', 'Blood donation']","[{'cui': 'C0033137', 'cui_str': 'Primary Care'}, {'cui': 'C0004927', 'cui_str': 'Behavior finding'}, {'cui': 'C0018704', 'cui_str': 'Healthcare facility'}, {'cui': 'C1301808', 'cui_str': 'State'}]",[],"[{'cui': 'C0033963', 'cui_str': 'Psychosocial Factors'}, {'cui': 'C0332257', 'cui_str': 'Including'}, {'cui': 'C0681189', 'cui_str': 'Religiosity'}, {'cui': 'C0376554', 'cui_str': 'Knowledge'}, {'cui': 'C0005794', 'cui_str': 'Blood Donation'}, {'cui': 'C1522240', 'cui_str': 'Process'}, {'cui': 'C0282416', 'cui_str': 'Overall'}, {'cui': 'C0518214', 'cui_str': 'Quality of life satisfaction'}, {'cui': 'C0439828', 'cui_str': 'Variable'}, {'cui': 'C0522183', 'cui_str': 'Fear of blood'}, {'cui': 'C0021485', 'cui_str': 'Injection of therapeutic agent'}, {'cui': 'C0004927', 'cui_str': 'Behavior finding'}, {'cui': 'C0015726', 'cui_str': 'Fear'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0009253', 'cui_str': 'Intercourse'}, {'cui': 'C0086996', 'cui_str': 'Socioeconomic Status'}, {'cui': 'C0013658', 'cui_str': 'Educational achievement'}, {'cui': 'C0042420', 'cui_str': 'Vasovagal syncope'}]",1055.0,0.0224313,"Participants completed measures assessing psychosocial variables, including religiosity, knowledge regarding blood donation process, overall quality of life, blood donation of peers, sociodemographic variables, and the fear of blood, injections, and fainting.","[{'ForeName': 'Miriane L', 'Initials': 'ML', 'LastName': 'Zucoloto', 'Affiliation': 'Ribeirão Preto Medical School, University of São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil.

390,31568142,Trajectory Analysis of Cognitive Outcomes in Children With Perinatal HIV.,"BACKGROUND


Children with perinatal HIV (pHIV) may display distinct long-term cognitive phenotypes. We used group-based trajectory modeling to identify clusters of children with pHIV after similar developmental trajectories and predictors of belonging to select cognitive trajectory groups.
METHODS


Participants included children, 4-17 years of age, with pHIV in Thailand and Cambodia. Cognitive measures included translated versions of Intelligence Quotient tests, Color Trails Tests and Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration conducted semiannually over 3-6 years. The best fit of trajectory groups was determined using maximum likelihood estimation. Multivariate logistic regression identified baseline factors associated with belonging to the lowest scoring trajectory group.
RESULTS


Group-based trajectory analyses revealed a 3-cluster classification for each cognitive test, labeled as high, medium and low scoring groups. Most trajectory group scores remained stable across age. Verbal IQ declined in all 3 trajectory groups and the high scoring group for Children's Color Trails Test 1 and 2 showed an increase in scores across age. Children in the lowest scoring trajectory group were more likely to present at an older age and report lower household income.
CONCLUSIONS


Group-based trajectory modeling succinctly classifies cohort heterogeneity in cognitive outcomes in pHIV. Most trajectories remained stable across age suggesting that cognitive potential is likely determined at an early age with the exception of a small subgroup of children who displayed developmental gains in select cognitive domains and may represent those with better cognitive reserve. Poverty and longer duration of untreated HIV may predispose children with pHIV to suboptimal cognitive development.",2019,Verbal IQ declined in all 3 trajectory groups and the high scoring group for Children's Color Trails Test 1 and 2 showed an increase in scores across age.,"['Children with perinatal HIV (pHIV', 'Children With Perinatal HIV', 'Participants included children, 4-17 years of age, with pHIV in Thailand and Cambodia']",[],"['Verbal IQ', 'translated versions of Intelligence Quotient tests, Color Trails Tests and Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration conducted semiannually over 3-6 years']","[{'cui': 'C0008059', 'cui_str': 'Child'}, {'cui': 'C0178795', 'cui_str': 'Perinatal period'}, {'cui': 'C0019682', 'cui_str': 'Human immunodeficiency virus'}, {'cui': 'C0332257', 'cui_str': 'Including'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0039725', 'cui_str': 'Thailand'}, {'cui': 'C0006797', 'cui_str': 'Cambodia'}]",[],"[{'cui': 'C0439824', 'cui_str': 'Verbal'}, {'cui': 'C0040710', 'cui_str': 'Translating'}, {'cui': 'C2607870', 'cui_str': 'Version'}, {'cui': 'C0456149', 'cui_str': 'Intelligence quotient'}, {'cui': 'C0003647', 'cui_str': 'Aptitude Tests'}, {'cui': 'C0009393', 'cui_str': 'Color'}, {'cui': 'C0385242', 'cui_str': 'Apo-2 Ligand'}, {'cui': 'C0458003', 'cui_str': 'Developmental'}, {'cui': 'C0234621', 'cui_str': 'Visual'}, {'cui': 'C0004927', 'cui_str': 'Behavior finding'}, {'cui': 'C0442759', 'cui_str': '3/6'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}]",,0.0360208,Verbal IQ declined in all 3 trajectory groups and the high scoring group for Children's Color Trails Test 1 and 2 showed an increase in scores across age.,"[{'ForeName': 'Payal B', 'Initials': 'PB', 'LastName': 'Patel', 'Affiliation': 'From the Department of Neurology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.'}, {'ForeName': 'Tanakorn', 'Initials': 'T', 'LastName': 'Apornpong', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Statistics, HIV-NAT, The Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Center, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Thanyawee', 'Initials': 'T', 'LastName': 'Puthanakit', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kulvadee', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Thongpibul', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Faculty of Humanities, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Pope', 'Initials': 'P', 'LastName': 'Kosalaraksa', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Rawiwan', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Hansudewechakul', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Infectious Diseases, Chiangrai Prachanukroh Hospital, Chiang Rai, Thailand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Suparat', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Kanjanavanit', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Infectious Diseases, Nakornping Hospital, Chiang Mai, Thailand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Chiawat', 'Initials': 'C', 'LastName': 'Ngampiyaskul', 'Affiliation': 'Prapokklao Hospital, Chantaburi, Thailand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Wicharn', 'Initials': 'W', 'LastName': 'Luesomboon', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Infectious Diseases, Queen Savang Vadhana Memorial Hospital, Chonburi, Thailand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jurai', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Wongsawat', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Infectious Diseases, Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Nonthaburi, Thailand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Ly Penh', 'Initials': 'LP', 'LastName': 'Sun', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Diseases, National Center for HIV/AIDS Dermatology and STDs, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kea', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Chettra', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Department of Infectious Diseases, National Center for HIV/AIDS Dermatology and STDs, Phnom Penh, Cambodia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Vonthanak', 'Initials': 'V', 'LastName': 'Saphonn', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Infectious Diseases, University of Health Sciences, Phnom Pehn, Cambodia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Claude A', 'Initials': 'CA', 'LastName': 'Mellins', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Medical Psychology, HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies, New York State Psychiatric Institute, and Columbia University, New York, New York.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kathleen', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Malee', 'Affiliation': 'Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Chicago, Illinois.'}, {'ForeName': 'Serena', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Spudich', 'Affiliation': 'From the Department of Neurology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jintanat', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Ananworanich', 'Affiliation': 'Department of HIV Therapeutics Research, The Henry M.

391,32349359,Effectiveness of the Reasoning and Rehabilitation V2 Programme for Improving Personal and Social Skills in Spanish Adolescent Students.,"Significant progress has been made in developing intervention programmes for adolescents at high risk of delinquency, school failure and emotional problems. The most effective programmes incorporate behavioural and skills training aimed at changing attitudes and promoting psychosocial and emotional skills in adolescents. This study examined the effectiveness of a school-based intervention programme based on the Reasoning and Rehabilitation V2 (R&R2). R&R2 is a cognitive behavioural programme developed using psychological theories about the aetiology of delinquency, as well as the cognitive, behavioural and socioemotional deficits in high-risk youth populations. A sample of 142 students (aged 13-17 years old) who were attending alternative education provision in Spain were randomly assigned to two experimental conditions (68 experimental group, 74 control group). The results showed that the R&R2 improved participants' self-esteem, social skills, empathy and rational problem-solving with a medium-large effect size (η2 = 0.08 to 0.26). The effects of the programme were significant after controlling for age and the pre-test scores in baseline. These findings confirm the effectiveness of the Reasoning and Rehabilitation V2 programme in Spanish adolescent students and offer additional evidence regarding the implementation of the R&R2 programme in both alternative educational and mainstream school settings.",2020,"The results showed that the R&R2 improved participants' self-esteem, social skills, empathy and rational problem-solving with a medium-large effect size (η2 = 0.08 to 0.26).","['142 students (aged 13-17 years old) who were attending alternative education provision in Spain', 'Spanish Adolescent Students', 'Spanish adolescent students', 'adolescents at high risk of delinquency, school failure and emotional problems', 'adolescents']","['Reasoning and Rehabilitation V2 Programme', 'R&R2', 'school-based intervention programme']","['Personal and Social Skills', ""R&R2 improved participants' self-esteem, social skills, empathy and rational problem-solving with a medium-large effect size""]","[{'cui': 'C0038492', 'cui_str': 'Student'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0580836', 'cui_str': 'Old'}, {'cui': 'C1456498', 'cui_str': 'Attended'}, {'cui': 'C0729314', 'cui_str': 'Education provision'}, {'cui': 'C0037747', 'cui_str': 'Spain'}, {'cui': 'C0037750', 'cui_str': 'Spanish language'}, {'cui': 'C0205653', 'cui_str': 'Adolescent'}, {'cui': 'C0332167', 'cui_str': 'High risk of'}, {'cui': 'C0022438', 'cui_str': 'Juvenile Delinquency'}, {'cui': 'C0681374', 'cui_str': 'Academic Failure'}, {'cui': 'C0677660', 'cui_str': 'Emotional problems'}]","[{'cui': 'C0684328', 'cui_str': 'Reasoning'}, {'cui': 'C0007237', 'cui_str': 'Care involving use of rehabilitation procedure, unspecified'}, {'cui': 'C0036375', 'cui_str': 'School'}, {'cui': 'C0002055', 'cui_str': 'Alkali'}, {'cui': 'C0184661', 'cui_str': 'Procedure'}]","[{'cui': 'C0679005', 'cui_str': 'Social Abilities'}, {'cui': 'C0684328', 'cui_str': 'Reasoning'}, {'cui': 'C0007237', 'cui_str': 'Care involving use of rehabilitation procedure, unspecified'}, {'cui': 'C0184511', 'cui_str': 'Improved'}, {'cui': 'C0036597', 'cui_str': 'Self-esteem'}, {'cui': 'C0013989', 'cui_str': 'Empathy'}, {'cui': 'C0033211', 'cui_str': 'Problem solving'}, {'cui': 'C0009458', 'cui_str': 'Communications Media'}, {'cui': 'C0549177', 'cui_str': 'Large'}, {'cui': 'C1280500', 'cui_str': 'Effect'}, {'cui': 'C0456389', 'cui_str': 'Size'}]",142.0,0.0212119,"The results showed that the R&R2 improved participants' self-esteem, social skills, empathy and rational problem-solving with a medium-large effect size (η2 = 0.08 to 0.26).","[{'ForeName': 'Miriam', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Sánchez-SanSegundo', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Health Psychology, Faculty of Health Science, University of Alicante, 03690 Alicante, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Rosario', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Ferrer-Cascales', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Health Psychology, Faculty of Health Science, University of Alicante, 03690 Alicante, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Natalia', 'Initials': 'N', 'LastName': 'Albaladejo-Blazquez', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Health Psychology, Faculty of Health Science, University of Alicante, 03690 Alicante, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Raquel', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Alarcó-Rosales', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Health Psychology, Faculty of Health Science, University of Alicante, 03690 Alicante, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Nicola', 'Initials': 'N', 'LastName': 'Bowes', 'Affiliation': 'Cardiff School of Sport and Health Sciences, University of Cardiff, Cardiff CF23 6XD, UK.'}, {'ForeName': 'Nicolás', 'Initials': 'N', 'LastName': 'Ruiz-Robledillo', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Health Psychology, Faculty of Health Science, University of Alicante, 03690 Alicante, Spain.'}]",International journal of environmental research and public health,['10.3390/ijerph17093040']
392,32349366,Site-Specific Effects of Online rTMS during a Working Memory Task in Healthy Older Adults.,"The process of manipulating information within working memory is central to many cognitive functions, but also declines rapidly in old age. Improving this process could markedly enhance the health-span in older adults. The current pre-registered, randomized and placebo-controlled study tested the potential of online repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied at 5 Hz over the left lateral parietal cortex to enhance working memory manipulation in healthy elderly adults. rTMS was applied, while participants performed a delayed-response alphabetization task with two individually titrated levels of difficulty. Coil placement and stimulation amplitude were calculated from fMRI activation maps combined with electric field modeling on an individual-subject basis in order to standardize dosing at the targeted cortical location. Contrary to the a priori hypothesis, active rTMS significantly decreased accuracy relative to sham, and only in the hardest difficulty level. When compared to the results from our previous study, in which rTMS was applied over the left prefrontal cortex, we found equivalent effect sizes but opposite directionality suggesting a site-specific effect of rTMS. These results demonstrate engagement of cortical working memory processing using a novel TMS targeting approach, while also providing prescriptions for future studies seeking to enhance memory through rTMS.",2020,"Contrary to the a priori hypothesis, active rTMS significantly decreased accuracy relative to sham, and only in the hardest difficulty level.","['healthy elderly adults', 'Healthy Older Adults', 'older adults']","['Online rTMS', 'online repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS', 'rTMS', 'placebo']",['health-span'],"[{'cui': 'C0001792', 'cui_str': 'Elderly person'}, {'cui': 'C0001675', 'cui_str': 'Adult'}]","[{'cui': 'C0872259', 'cui_str': 'Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Repetitive'}, {'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}]","[{'cui': 'C0018684', 'cui_str': 'Health'}]",,0.0191049,"Contrary to the a priori hypothesis, active rTMS significantly decreased accuracy relative to sham, and only in the hardest difficulty level.","[{'ForeName': 'Lysianne', 'Initials': 'L', 'LastName': 'Beynel', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Duke University School of Medicine, 200 Trent Drive, Box 3620 DUMC, Durham, NC 27710, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Simon W', 'Initials': 'SW', 'LastName': 'Davis', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Duke University School of Medicine, 3116 N Duke Street, Durham, NC 27704, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Courtney A', 'Initials': 'CA', 'LastName': 'Crowell', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Duke University School of Medicine, 200 Trent Drive, Box 3620 DUMC, Durham, NC 27710, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Moritz', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Dannhauer', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Duke University School of Medicine, 200 Trent Drive, Box 3620 DUMC, Durham, NC 27710, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Wesley', 'Initials': 'W', 'LastName': 'Lim', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Duke University School of Medicine, 200 Trent Drive, Box 3620 DUMC, Durham, NC 27710, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Hannah', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Palmer', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Duke University School of Medicine, 200 Trent Drive, Box 3620 DUMC, Durham, NC 27710, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Susan A', 'Initials': 'SA', 'LastName': 'Hilbig', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Duke University School of Medicine, 200 Trent Drive, Box 3620 DUMC, Durham, NC 27710, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Alexandra', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Brito', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Duke University School of Medicine, 200 Trent Drive, Box 3620 DUMC, Durham, NC 27710, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Connor', 'Initials': 'C', 'LastName': 'Hile', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Duke University School of Medicine, 200 Trent Drive, Box 3620 DUMC, Durham, NC 27710, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Bruce', 'Initials': 'B', 'LastName': 'Luber', 'Affiliation': 'National Institute of Mental Health, 6001 Executive Boulevard, Bethesda, MD 20852, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Sarah H', 'Initials': 'SH', 'LastName': 'Lisanby', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Duke University School of Medicine, 200 Trent Drive, Box 3620 DUMC, Durham, NC 27710, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Angel V', 'Initials': 'AV', 'LastName': 'Peterchev', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Duke University School of Medicine, 200 Trent Drive, Box 3620 DUMC, Durham, NC 27710, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Roberto', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Cabeza', 'Affiliation': 'Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, Duke University, 308 Research Drive, Durham, NC 27710, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Lawrence G', 'Initials': 'LG', 'LastName': 'Appelbaum', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Duke University School of Medicine, 200 Trent Drive, Box 3620 DUMC, Durham, NC 27710, USA.'}]",Brain sciences,['10.3390/brainsci10050255']

Twenty-one outpatients with aMCI were randomized to either the VR-based training group or the control group in a 1∶1 ratio. The VR-based training group participated in training for 30 min/day, two days/week, for three months (24 times). The VR-based program was designed based on Korean traditional culture and used attention, processing speed, executive function and memory conditions to stimulate cognitive function.

394,32349429,Effect of Lupin-Enriched Biscuits as Substitute Mid-Meal Snacks on Post-Prandial Interstitial Glucose Excursions in Post-Surgical Hospital Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.,"Hospital biscuit snacks offered to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients may adversely affect glycaemic control. This study investigated the effect of lupin mid-meal biscuit snacks, compared to spelt or standard hospital biscuits, on interstitial glucose levels in post-operative T2DM inpatients. In a pilot cross-over pragmatic study, 20 patients (74 ± 12 years) consumed, in order, lupin biscuits (20% lupin), wholemeal spelt and standard plain sweet biscuits as mid-meal snacks (2 biscuits each for morning and afternoon tea) on three consecutive days. Continuous glucose monitoring, appetite perceptions and bowel motions were recorded. Glucose levels were not significantly different in the first 90 min after mid-meal biscuit consumption at morning and afternoon tea, irrespective of type. However, after consuming the lupin biscuits only, glucose levels were significantly ( p  < 0.001) reduced 90 min postprandially after dinner, indicating a potential second-meal effect. Patients also reported improved satiety after lupin biscuit consumption on day 1, compared to days 2 and 3 ( p  = 0.018). These findings suggest that lupin-enriched biscuits may improve both glycaemic control and satiety in hospitalised T2DM patients, potentially contributing to reduced length of stay. Larger controlled studies are warranted to confirm these findings and inform potential revision of hospital menu standards for T2DM patients.",2020,"Patients also reported improved satiety after lupin biscuit consumption on day 1, compared to days 2 and 3 ( p  = 0.018).","['20 patients (74 ± 12 years) consumed, in order, lupin biscuits (20% lupin), wholemeal spelt and standard plain sweet biscuits as mid-meal snacks (2 biscuits each for morning and afternoon tea) on three consecutive days', 'hospitalised T2DM patients', 'Post-Surgical Hospital Patients with Type 2 Diabetes', 'post-operative T2DM inpatients', 'T2DM patients']","['Lupin-Enriched Biscuits as Substitute Mid-Meal Snacks', 'Hospital biscuit snacks', 'lupin mid-meal biscuit snacks']","['glycaemic control and satiety', 'glucose levels', 'Continuous glucose monitoring, appetite perceptions and bowel motions', 'interstitial glucose levels', 'Glucose levels', 'satiety after lupin biscuit consumption']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C4284072', 'cui_str': 'Order document'}, {'cui': 'C0330813', 'cui_str': 'Lupinus'}, {'cui': 'C0452501', 'cui_str': 'Cookie and/or cracker'}, {'cui': 'C0331515', 'cui_str': 'Triticum spelta'}, {'cui': 'C0038137', 'cui_str': 'standards'}, {'cui': 'C0085077', 'cui_str': 'Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis'}, {'cui': 'C0444598', 'cui_str': 'Mid'}, {'cui': 'C1998602', 'cui_str': 'Meals'}, {'cui': 'C0453863', 'cui_str': 'Snack food'}, {'cui': 'C0332170', 'cui_str': 'Morning'}, {'cui': 'C0439550', 'cui_str': 'Afternoon'}, {'cui': 'C0039400', 'cui_str': 'Tea'}, {'cui': 'C0332173', 'cui_str': 'Daily'}, {'cui': 'C0011860', 'cui_str': 'Type 2 diabetes mellitus'}, {'cui': 'C0687676', 'cui_str': 'After values'}, {'cui': 'C0543467', 'cui_str': 'Surgery'}, {'cui': 'C0239966', 'cui_str': 'Hospital patient'}, {'cui': 'C0332307', 'cui_str': 'Type - attribute'}, {'cui': 'C0032790', 'cui_str': 'Postoperative period'}, {'cui': 'C0021562', 'cui_str': 'Inpatient'}]","[{'cui': 'C0330813', 'cui_str': 'Lupinus'}, {'cui': 'C0452501', 'cui_str': 'Cookie and/or cracker'}, {'cui': 'C0444598', 'cui_str': 'Mid'}, {'cui': 'C1998602', 'cui_str': 'Meals'}, {'cui': 'C0453863', 'cui_str': 'Snack food'}, {'cui': 'C0019994', 'cui_str': 'Hospitals'}]","[{'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}, {'cui': 'C0036239', 'cui_str': 'Satiety'}, {'cui': 'C0337438', 'cui_str': 'Glucose measurement'}, {'cui': 'C0549178', 'cui_str': 'Continuous'}, {'cui': 'C0017725', 'cui_str': 'Glucose'}, {'cui': 'C0150369', 'cui_str': 'Preventive monitoring'}, {'cui': 'C0003618', 'cui_str': 'Food appetite'}, {'cui': 'C0030971', 'cui_str': 'Perception'}, {'cui': 'C0021853', 'cui_str': 'Intestinal'}, {'cui': 'C0026597', 'cui_str': 'Motion'}, {'cui': 'C1522203', 'cui_str': 'Interstitial route'}, {'cui': 'C0330813', 'cui_str': 'Lupinus'}, {'cui': 'C0452501', 'cui_str': 'Cookie and/or cracker'}, {'cui': 'C0009830', 'cui_str': 'Consumption'}]",20.0,0.0156027,"Patients also reported improved satiety after lupin biscuit consumption on day 1, compared to days 2 and 3 ( p  = 0.018).","[{'ForeName': 'Sophie', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Skalkos', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Dietetics, Nutrition and Sport, School of Allied Health, Human Services and Sport, La Trobe University, Victoria 3086, Australia.'}, {'ForeName': 'George', 'Initials': 'G', 'LastName': 'Moschonis', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Dietetics, Nutrition and Sport, School of Allied Health, Human Services and Sport, La Trobe University, Victoria 3086, Australia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Colleen J', 'Initials': 'CJ', 'LastName': 'Thomas', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Victoria 3086, Australia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Joanna', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'McMillan', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Dietetics, Nutrition and Sport, School of Allied Health, Human Services and Sport, La Trobe University, Victoria 3086, Australia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Antigone', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Kouris-Blazos', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Dietetics, Nutrition and Sport, School of Allied Health, Human Services and Sport, La Trobe University, Victoria 3086, Australia.'}]",Nutrients,['10.3390/nu12051239']
395,32378340,Changes in strength and power performance and serum hormone concentrations during 12 weeks of task-specific or strength training in conscripts.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of two different training programs on strength and power performance and serum hormone concentrations. A total of 104 male soldiers volunteered and took part in the 12-week training period with baseline, mid-, and post-measurements of body composition, muscle strength, lower and upper body power, and blood samples to determine serum hormone concentrations. The mean (±SD) age of subjects was 20 ± 1 years, height 180 ± 6 cm and body mass 72.4 ± 8.8 kg. The subjects were divided into three different training groups: soldier task-specific training (TS), strength training (ST), and control (CON). Each group had a total of 18 training sessions during the 12-week study. In the muscle strength tests, most improvements could be observed in the TS and ST groups, especially, during the first weeks of the training period. Maximal isometric leg extension force increased significantly by 7.9 ± 12.2% (p < .05) in the TS and 7.1 ± 12.6% (p < .05) in the ST groups between the PRE and MID, as well as between the PRE and POST measurements by 8.1 ± 12.4% (p < .05) in TS and 12.3 ± 15.3% (p < .01) in ST. Serum TES concentration increased significantly in TS between the PRE and MID (16.8 ± 33.9%) and PRE and POST (11.2 ± 16.7%) measurements. Serum COR concentrations decreased in TS between the MID and POST (-7.8 ± 10.9%) and PRE and POST (-11.0 ± 14.3%) measurements. Although the differences observed were rather minor in magnitude, training in the TS and ST groups led to greater improvements in muscle strength and power performance compared to the training in the CON group. The development of strength and/or power of the lower and upper body was greater in the TS and ST groups, which is crucial for warfighter's performance. Therefore, it is important to have a structured resistance-training program during military training to optimize the strength, power, and military-specific performance.",2020,"The development of strength and/or power of the lower and upper body was greater in the TS and ST groups, which is crucial for warfighter's performance.","['The mean (±SD) age of subjects was 20\xa0±\xa01\xa0years, height 180\xa0±\xa06\xa0cm and body mass 72.4\xa0±\xa08.8\xa0kg', '104 male soldiers volunteered and took part']","['soldier task-specific training (TS), strength training (ST), and control (CON', 'POST']","['Serum TES concentration', 'Maximal isometric leg extension force', 'strength and power performance and serum hormone concentrations', 'strength and/or power of the lower and upper body', 'Serum COR concentrations', 'muscle strength and power performance']","[{'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0005890', 'cui_str': 'Body height measure'}, {'cui': 'C4319557', 'cui_str': '180'}, {'cui': 'C0152338', 'cui_str': 'Structure of body of caudate nucleus'}, {'cui': 'C0577559', 'cui_str': 'Mass of body structure'}, {'cui': 'C4517882', 'cui_str': '8.8'}, {'cui': 'C4517527', 'cui_str': '104'}, {'cui': 'C0086582', 'cui_str': 'Male'}, {'cui': 'C0524647', 'cui_str': 'Soldiers'}, {'cui': 'C0042960', 'cui_str': 'Voluntary worker'}, {'cui': 'C1515187', 'cui_str': 'Take'}]","[{'cui': 'C0524647', 'cui_str': 'Soldiers'}, {'cui': 'C0205369', 'cui_str': 'Specific'}, {'cui': 'C0040607', 'cui_str': 'Training Programs'}, {'cui': 'C0872279', 'cui_str': 'Strength Training'}, {'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}, {'cui': 'C0687676', 'cui_str': 'After values'}]","[{'cui': 'C0229671', 'cui_str': 'Serum'}, {'cui': 'C0004268', 'cui_str': 'Attention'}, {'cui': 'C0205289', 'cui_str': 'Maximal'}, {'cui': 'C0022206', 'cui_str': 'Isometric exercise'}, {'cui': 'C0023216', 'cui_str': 'Lower limb structure'}, {'cui': 'C0231448', 'cui_str': 'Extension'}, {'cui': 'C0443221', 'cui_str': 'Forced'}, {'cui': 'C0019932', 'cui_str': 'Hormone'}, {'cui': 'C0205251', 'cui_str': 'Low'}, {'cui': 'C1268087', 'cui_str': 'Upper body structure'}, {'cui': 'C0018787', 'cui_str': 'Heart structure'}, {'cui': 'C0517349', 'cui_str': 'Muscle Strength'}]",104.0,0.0128887,"The development of strength and/or power of the lower and upper body was greater in the TS and ST groups, which is crucial for warfighter's performance.","[{'ForeName': 'Tommi', 'Initials': 'T', 'LastName': 'Ojanen', 'Affiliation': 'Finnish Defence Research Agency, Finnish Defence Forces, Järvenpää, Finland.'}, {'ForeName': 'Heikki', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Kyröläinen', 'Affiliation': 'Biology of Physical Activity, University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland.'}, {'ForeName': 'Elena', 'Initials': 'E', 'LastName': 'Kozharskaya', 'Affiliation': 'Biology of Physical Activity, University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland.'}, {'ForeName': 'Keijo', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Häkkinen', 'Affiliation': 'Biology of Physical Activity, University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland.'}]",Physiological reports,['10.14814/phy2.14422']

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of Kinesio Taping and compression stockings on pain, edema, functional capacity and quality of life in patients with chronic venous disease (CVD).
DESIGN


This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical trial.
SETTING


The study was conducted in a physiotherapy and rehabilitation unit of a university hospital.
SUBJECTS


A total of 62 patients with early-stage CVD were allocated to either an experimental group or a control group.
INTERVENTIONS


Experimental group ( n  = 29) received Kinesio Taping intervention once a week for four weeks, while control group ( n  = 29) received compression stockings for four weeks. All patients additionally undertook an exercise training programme including calf muscle pump exercises, flexibility exercises and diaphragmatic breathing.
MAIN MEASURES


Visual analogue scale, lower limb circumference measurements, 6-minute walk test and Short Form 36 questionnaire were applied before and after four weeks of treatment.
RESULTS


Control group showed statistically significant improvements in pain ( P  < 0.001), ankle circumferences (right,  P  = 0.002; left,  P  = 0.037), calf circumferences (right,  P  = 0.020; left,  P  = 0.022), knee circumference (left,  P  = 0.039) and thigh circumferences (right,  P  = 0.029; left,  P  = 0.002) compared with experimental group.

398,32349543,Effects of a core stabilization training program on balance ability in persons with Parkinson's disease: a randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE


To explore the effects of an eight-week core stability program on balance ability in persons with Parkinson's disease.
DESIGN


Randomized controlled trial.
SETTING


A local Parkinson's association.
SUBJECTS


A total of 44 participants with a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease were randomly assigned to an experimental ( n  = 22) or control group ( n  = 22).
INTERVENTION


The experimental group received 24 sessions of core training, while the control group received an intervention including active joint mobilization, muscle stretching, and motor coordination exercises.
MAIN MEASURES


The primary outcome measure was dynamic balance evaluated using the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test. Secondary outcomes included the balance confidence assessed with the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale and standing balance assessed by the maximal excursion of center of pressure during the Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance and the Limits of Stability test.
RESULTS


After treatment, a significant between-group improvement in dynamic balance was observed in the experimental group compared to the control group (change, 2.75 ± 1.80 vs 0.38 ± 2.15,  P  = 0.002). The experimental group also showed a significant improvement in confidence (change, 16.48 ± 16.21 vs 3.05 ± 13.53,  P  = 0.047) and maximal excursion of center of pressure in forward (change, 0.86 ± 1.89 cm vs 0.17 ± 0.26 cm,  P  = 0.048), left (change, 0.88 ± 2.63 cm vs 0.07 ± 0.48 cm,  P  = 0.010), and right (change, 1.63 ± 2.82 cm vs 0.05 ± 0.17 cm,  P  = 0.046) directions of limits of stability compared to the control group.
CONCLUSION


A program based on core stability in comparison with non-specific exercise benefits dynamic balance and confidence and increases center of mass excursion in patients with Parkinson's disease.",2020,"After treatment, a significant between-group improvement in dynamic balance was observed in the experimental group compared to the control group (change, 2.75 ± 1.80 vs 0.38 ± 2.15,  P  = 0.002).","[""patients with Parkinson's disease"", ""44 participants with a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease"", ""persons with Parkinson's disease""]","['core stabilization training program', 'eight-week core stability program', '24 sessions of core training, while the control group received an intervention including active joint mobilization, muscle stretching, and motor coordination exercises']","['maximal excursion of center of pressure', 'balance confidence assessed with the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale and standing balance assessed by the maximal excursion of center of pressure during the Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance and the Limits of Stability test', 'balance ability', 'dynamic balance evaluated using the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test', 'confidence', 'dynamic balance']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0030567', 'cui_str': ""Parkinson's disease""}, {'cui': 'C0332140', 'cui_str': 'Clinical diagnosis'}, {'cui': 'C0027361', 'cui_str': 'Person'}]","[{'cui': 'C0444669', 'cui_str': 'Core'}, {'cui': 'C1293130', 'cui_str': 'Stabilization'}, {'cui': 'C0040607', 'cui_str': 'Training Programs'}, {'cui': 'C0439230', 'cui_str': 'week'}, {'cui': 'C0205360', 'cui_str': 'Stable'}, {'cui': 'C0018106', 'cui_str': 'Government Programs'}, {'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}, {'cui': 'C0184661', 'cui_str': 'Procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0332257', 'cui_str': 'Including'}, {'cui': 'C0205177', 'cui_str': 'Active'}, {'cui': 'C0231588', 'cui_str': 'Physiatric mobilization of joint'}, {'cui': 'C0407178', 'cui_str': 'Stretching of muscle'}, {'cui': 'C0203990', 'cui_str': 'Coordination exercise'}]","[{'cui': 'C0205289', 'cui_str': 'Maximal'}, {'cui': 'C0205099', 'cui_str': 'Central'}, {'cui': 'C0033095', 'cui_str': 'Pressure - physical agent'}, {'cui': 'C0014653', 'cui_str': 'Equilibrium'}, {'cui': 'C0237529', 'cui_str': 'Self-confidence'}, {'cui': 'C2733457', 'cui_str': 'Activities specific balance confidence scale'}, {'cui': 'C0231472', 'cui_str': 'Orthostatic body position'}, {'cui': 'C0392747', 'cui_str': 'Changing'}, {'cui': 'C0205210', 'cui_str': 'Clinical'}, {'cui': 'C0003647', 'cui_str': 'Aptitude Tests'}, {'cui': 'C0445254', 'cui_str': 'Sensory'}, {'cui': 'C0021797', 'cui_str': 'Interpersonal Relations'}, {'cui': 'C0439801', 'cui_str': 'Limited'}, {'cui': 'C0205360', 'cui_str': 'Stable'}, {'cui': 'C0560184', 'cui_str': 'Ability to balance'}, {'cui': 'C0729333', 'cui_str': 'Dynamic'}, {'cui': 'C0445542', 'cui_str': 'Mini'}, {'cui': 'C0846574', 'cui_str': 'Psychiatric evaluation'}, {'cui': 'C0085104', 'cui_str': 'Drug Targeting'}]",44.0,0.0529084,"After treatment, a significant between-group improvement in dynamic balance was observed in the experimental group compared to the control group (change, 2.75 ± 1.80 vs 0.38 ± 2.15,  P  = 0.002).","[{'ForeName': 'Irene', 'Initials': 'I', 'LastName': 'Cabrera-Martos', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Ana Teresa', 'Initials': 'AT', 'LastName': 'Jiménez-Martín', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Laura', 'Initials': 'L', 'LastName': 'López-López', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Janet', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Rodríguez-Torres', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Araceli', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Ortiz-Rubio', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Marie Carmen', 'Initials': 'MC', 'LastName': 'Valenza', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.'}]",Clinical rehabilitation,['10.1177/0269215520918631']
399,32349565,Disease activity and treatment efficacy using patient-level Psoriasis Area and Severity Index scores from tildrakizumab phase 3 clinical trials.,"Background:  It is unclear whether primary efficacy outcomes in plaque psoriasis clinical trials represent residual disease during treatment. Objectives:  To evaluate supplementing dichotomous efficacy with residual disease activity. Methods:  This post hoc analysis used pooled, patient-level data after tildrakizumab 100 mg ( N  = 616) or placebo ( N  = 309) treatment from reSURFACE 1/2 (NCT01722331/NCT01729754) phase 3 clinical trials of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Results:  Median baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) was 17.9 for patients receiving tildrakizumab 100 mg. At Week 12, median PASI was 2.9, whereas dichotomous PASI 90 response rate was 36.9%, and absolute PASI <5.0, <3.0, and <1.0 were 64.0%, 50.8%, and 23.3%, respectively. At Week 28, median PASI was 1.7, whereas PASI 90 response rate was 51.9%, and absolute PASI <5.0, <3.0, and <1.0 were 75.3%, 62.8%, and 38.0%, respectively. Dermatology Life Quality Index and PASI scores were correlated through Week 28 ( r  = 0.51,  p  ≤ .0001).

400,32349629,Resistance training with blood flow restriction: impact on the muscle strength and body composition in people living with HIV/AIDS.,"The aim of the study was to compare the impact of 12-week resistance training with blood flow restriction (G RTBFR ) versus, traditional resistance training (G TRT ) and non-training on the muscle strength and body composition HIV/AIDS participants. Muscle strength was tested at baseline, and on the 6th, 21st and 36th training sessions, using maximal repetition test. Pre- and post-intervention body composition changes were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Resistance-training was undertaken three times a week comprising bilateral elbow extension and flexion exercises, unilateral flexion and bilateral knee extension. Changes in strength and body composition (pre- and post-intervention) between groups were evaluated by mixed models of repeated measures, and by paired and unpaired comparisons, considering the Effect Size. All groups were similar at baseline for muscle strength and body composition. Post intervention, the training groups showed similar, statistically significant increases in muscle strength (G RTBFR =25.7 to 57.4%; G TRT= 24.5 to 52.3%) and skeletal muscle tissue (G RTBFR =8.4%; G TRT =8.3%). There was also significant change in body fat (p=0.023 to 0.043), with significant effect sizes for strength and skeletal muscle tissue (0.41 to 2.27), respectively. These results suggest that both resistance training interventions promoted muscle hypertrophy, body fat reduction and positive impact on muscle strength in people living with HIV/AIDS.

401,32349638,"Local Anesthetic Injection Resolves Movement Pain, Motor Dysfunction, and Pain Catastrophizing in Individuals With Chronic Achilles Tendinopathy, a Non-Randomized Clinical Trial.","OBJECTIVES


Peripherally-directed treatments (targeted exercise, surgery) can reduce, but not fully eliminate, pain for up to 40% of patients with Achilles tendinopathy. The objectives were to: 1) Identify indicators of altered central processing in participants with Achilles tendinopathy compared to controls; and 2) determine which indicators of altered central processing persisted after a local anesthetic injection in patients with Achilles tendinopathy.
DESIGN


Mechanistic clinical trial.
METHODS


46 adults participated (23 with chronic Achilles tendinopathy, 23 matched-controls; NCT03316378). All participants repeated: 1) movement-evoked pain rating, 2) motor performance, 3) pain psychology questionnaires; 4) quantitative sensory testing. Participants with Achilles tendinopathy received a local anesthetic injection before repeat testing and controls did not. Mixed-effects ANOVAs examined group, time, and group*time effects.
RESULTS


The Achilles tendinopathy group had movement-evoked pain, motor dysfunction, and higher pain psychological factors (pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia) compared to controls ( P <0.05). The Achilles tendinopathy group did not have indicators of nociplastic pain with quantitative sensory testing ( P >0.05). In those with Achilles tendinopathy, local anesthetic injection eliminated pain and normalized the observed deficits in heel raise performance and pain catastrophizing (group*time effect,  P <0.01), but not kinesiophobia ( P =0.45). Injection did not affect measures of nociplastic pain ( P >0.05).
CONCLUSION


People with Achilles tendinopathy had elevated pain psychological factors and motor dysfunction, but not signs of nociplastic pain with quantitative sensory testing. Removal of nociceptive input normalized movement-evoked pain and some indicators of altered central processing (motor dysfunction, pain catastrophizing), but not kinesiophobia.

402,32349642,Impact of pharmacist's intervention on decreasing erlotinib interactions in the treatment of lung cancer patients in low resource settings.,"BACKGROUND


This study aimed to demonstrate that having clinical pharmacist as a member of oncology team in low and middle income countries might lead to significant reduction in the number of erlotinib interactions in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer patients.
METHODS


A group of 44 patients was labeled as intervention group and they were analyzed prospectively in the period from 1 January 2017 to 1 May 2018 during clinical pharmacist's participation in regular weekly multidisciplinary oncology team meetings. The control group consisted of 44 out of 110 patients treated with erlotinib before the involvement of a clinical pharmacist in oncology team, match paired with 44 patients in intervention group.
RESULTS


Clinically significant interactions were identified in two-thirds of studied patients (57 out of 88). Most drug interactions, 38%, potentially result in decrease of serum concentration of erlotinib. Clinical pharmacist provided therapy modification suggestions for 32 out of 44 (72.72%) patients in the intervention group, most of which were accepted by doctors. In the intervention group, there were significantly less clinically significant interactions compared to the control group (10 versus 24, p = 0.002). Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the pharmacist's intervention group (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS


Clinical pharmacist's intervention led to significant decrease in erlotinib interactions which may result in treatment optimization of lung cancer patients.",2020,"Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the pharmacist's intervention group (p = 0.001).

403,31671757,Maternal Human Milk Oligosaccharide Profile Modulates the Impact of an Intervention with Iron and Galacto-Oligosaccharides in Kenyan Infants.,"There is little data on human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) composition in Sub-Saharan Africa. Iron fortificants adversely affect the infant gut microbiota, while co-provision of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) mitigates most of the adverse effects. Whether variations in maternal HMO profile can influence the infant response to iron and/or GOS fortificants is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine HMO profiles and the secretor/non-secretor phenotype of lactating Kenyan mothers and investigate their effects on the maternal and infant gut microbiota, and on the infant response to a fortification intervention with 5 mg iron (2.5 mg as sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate and 2.5 mg as ferrous fumarate) and 7.5 g GOS. We studied mother-infant pairs ( n  = 80) participating in a 4-month intervention trial in which the infants (aged 6.5-9.5 months) received daily a micronutrient powder without iron, with iron or with iron and GOS. We assessed: (1) maternal secretor status and HMO composition; (2) effects of secretor status on the maternal and infant gut microbiota in a cross-sectional analysis at baseline of the intervention trial; and (3) interactions between secretor status and intervention groups during the intervention trial on the infant gut microbiota, gut inflammation, iron status, growth and infectious morbidity. Secretor prevalence was 72% and HMOs differed between secretors and non-secretors and over time of lactation. Secretor status did not predict the baseline composition of the maternal and infant gut microbiota. There was a secretor-status-by-intervention-group interaction on  Bifidobacterium  ( p  = 0.021), Z-scores for length-for-age ( p  = 0.022) and weight-for-age ( p  = 0.018), and soluble transferrin receptor ( p  = 0.041). In the no iron group, longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea was higher among infants of non-secretors (23.8%) than of secretors (10.4%) ( p  = 0.001). In conclusion, HMO profile may modulate the infant gut microbiota response to fortificant iron; compared to infants of secretor mothers, infants of non-secretor mothers may be more vulnerable to the adverse effect of iron but also benefit more from the co-provision of GOS.",2019,Secretor prevalence was 72% and HMOs differed between secretors and non-secretors and over time of lactation.,"['mother-infant pairs ( n  = 80) participating in a 4-month intervention trial in which the infants (aged 6.5-9.5 months) received', 'lactating Kenyan mothers', 'Kenyan Infants']","['daily a micronutrient powder without iron, with iron or with iron and GOS', 'sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate and 2.5 mg as ferrous fumarate']","['longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea', 'maternal secretor status and HMO composition; (2) effects of secretor status on the maternal and infant gut microbiota', 'soluble transferrin receptor', 'HMO profiles', 'infant gut microbiota, gut inflammation, iron status, growth and infectious morbidity', 'Secretor prevalence']","[{'cui': 'C0026591', 'cui_str': 'Mother'}, {'cui': 'C0021270', 'cui_str': 'Infant'}, {'cui': 'C0332177', 'cui_str': 'Monthly'}, {'cui': 'C0184661', 'cui_str': 'Procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0008976', 'cui_str': 'Clinical trial'}, {'cui': 'C3844007', 'cui_str': '6.5'}, {'cui': 'C4517899', 'cui_str': '9.5'}, {'cui': 'C0022924', 'cui_str': 'Lactates'}, {'cui': 'C0337839', 'cui_str': 'Kenyans'}]","[{'cui': 'C0332173', 'cui_str': 'Daily'}, {'cui': 'C0040577', 'cui_str': 'Trace element'}, {'cui': 'C0032861', 'cui_str': 'Powder'}, {'cui': 'C0082568', 'cui_str': 'ferryl iron'}, {'cui': 'C0028959', 'cui_str': 'Oligosaccharide'}, {'cui': 'C0037473', 'cui_str': 'Sodium'}, {'cui': 'C0178627', 'cui_str': 'ethylenediaminetetraacetate'}, {'cui': 'C3844011', 'cui_str': '2.5'}, {'cui': 'C0060276', 'cui_str': 'Ferrous fumarate'}]","[{'cui': 'C0205127', 'cui_str': 'Longitudinal'}, {'cui': 'C0033105', 'cui_str': 'Prevalence'}, {'cui': 'C0011991', 'cui_str': 'Diarrhea'}, {'cui': 'C0026591', 'cui_str': 'Mother'}, {'cui': 'C0449438', 'cui_str': 'Status'}, {'cui': 'C0026140', 'cui_str': 'Breast milk'}, {'cui': 'C0028959', 'cui_str': 'Oligosaccharide'}, {'cui': 'C0486616', 'cui_str': 'Composition (property)'}, {'cui': 'C1280500', 'cui_str': 'Effect'}, {'cui': 'C0021270', 'cui_str': 'Infant'}, {'cui': 'C2985398', 'cui_str': 'Intestinal Microbiota'}, {'cui': 'C1116139', 'cui_str': 'Transferrin receptor, soluble'}, {'cui': 'C0017189', 'cui_str': 'Gastrointestinal tract structure'}, {'cui': 'C0021368', 'cui_str': 'Inflammation'}, {'cui': 'C0082568', 'cui_str': 'ferryl iron'}, {'cui': 'C0018270', 'cui_str': 'Growth'}, {'cui': 'C0009450', 'cui_str': 'Communicable disease'}, {'cui': 'C0026538', 'cui_str': 'Morbidity'}]",80.0,0.0844578,Secretor prevalence was 72% and HMOs differed between secretors and non-secretors and over time of lactation.,"[{'ForeName': 'Daniela', 'Initials': 'D', 'LastName': 'Paganini', 'Affiliation': 'Laboratory of Human Nutrition, Department of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zurich, 8092 Zurich, Switzerland. daniela.paganini@uzh.ch.'}, {'ForeName': 'Mary A', 'Initials': 'MA', 'LastName': 'Uyoga', 'Affiliation': 'Laboratory of Human Nutrition, Department of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zurich, 8092 Zurich, Switzerland. mary.uyoga@hest.ethz.ch.'}, {'ForeName': 'Guus A M', 'Initials': 'GAM', 'LastName': 'Kortman', 'Affiliation': 'NIZO Food Research BV, 6718 ZB Ede, The Netherlands.

404,31761149,Usefulness of a Lifestyle Intervention in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease.,"The importance of modifying lifestyle factors in order to improve prognosis in cardiac patients is well-known. Current study aims to evaluate the effects of a lifestyle intervention on changes in lifestyle- and health data derived from wearable devices. Cardiac patients from Spain (n = 34) and The Netherlands (n = 36) were included in the current analysis. Data were collected for 210 days, using the Fitbit activity tracker, Beddit sleep tracker, Moves app (GPS tracker), and the Careportal home monitoring system. Locally Weighted Error Sum of Squares regression assessed trajectories of outcome variables. Linear Mixed Effects regression analysis was used to find relevant predictors of improvement deterioration of outcome measures. Analysis showed that Number of Steps and Activity Level significantly changed over time (F = 58.21, p < 0.001; F = 6.33, p = 0.01). No significant changes were observed on blood pressure, weight, and sleep efficiency. Secondary analysis revealed that being male was associated with higher activity levels (F = 12.53, p < 0.001) and higher number of steps (F = 8.44, p < 0.01). Secondary analysis revealed demographic (gender, nationality, marital status), clinical (co-morbidities, heart failure), and psychological (anxiety, depression) profiles that were associated with lifestyle measures. In conclusion results showed that physical activity increased over time and that certain subgroups of patients were more likely to have a better lifestyle behaviors based on their demographic, clinical, and psychological profile.

The study objective was to evaluate if and when patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation stop dabigatran treatment and to report outcomes following discontinuation. Patients prescribed dabigatran in diverse clinical practice settings were consecutively enrolled and followed for 2 years. Dabigatran persistence over time, reasons for discontinuation, and outcomes post discontinuation were assessed. Of 4,859 patients, aged 70.2 ± 10.4 years, 55.7% were male. Overall 2-year dabigatran persistence was 70.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 69.6 to 72.2). Persistence probability was lower in the first 6-month period (83.7% [82.7 to 84.8]) than in subsequent periods for patients on dabigatran at the start of each period (6 to 12 months, 92.5% [91.6 to 93.3]; 12 to 18 months, 95.1% [94.3 to 95.8]; 18 to 24 months, 96.3% [95.6 to 96.9]). Of 1,305 patients (26.9%) who discontinued dabigatran, adverse events were reported as the reason for discontinuation in 457 (35.0%).

Although exercise is recommended in the treatment of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpa), the focus has been on flexibility, and the effect of high-intensity exercises is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of high-intensity exercises on fatigue, sleep, and mood in patients with axSpA.
METHODS


In this secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial, participants were recruited from outpatient clinics at 4 hospitals in Scandinavia. One hundred patients with axSpA were randomized to either an exercise group (n = 50) or a control group (n = 50). High-intensity exercise was provided 3 times per week for 3 months, supervised by a physical therapist. The controls received no intervention. Measurements were self-reported at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months: fatigue, using the Fatigue Severity Scale (range = 0-7, 7 = worst, ≥5 = severe); vitality, using the RAND 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36, range = 0-100, 100 = best); sleep, using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (range = 0-21, 21 = worst, > 5 = poor quality); mood, using the General Health Questionnaire 12 (range = 0-36, 36 = worst); and general health, using the EUROQoL (range = 0-100, 100 = best).
RESULTS


Thirty-eight (76%) participants in the exercise group followed ≥80% of the exercise protocol. At 3 months, there was a significant beneficial effect on fatigue (mean group differences = -0.4, 95% CI = -0.7 to -0.1); vitality (5.0, 95% CI = 1.1 to 10.5), mood (-2, 95% CI = -3.7 to -0.04), and general health (9.0, 95% CI = 3.3 to 14.7), but no effect on sleep (-1.1, 95% CI = -2.1 to 0.2). When compared with the control group, the exercise group had a reduced rate of severe fatigue and poor sleep. No differences were seen between the groups at 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS


A 3-month exercise program had a beneficial effect on fatigue, sleep, mood, and general health in patients with axSpA at the end of the intervention; however, no long-term effects were seen.
IMPACT


High intensity cardiorespiratory and strength exercises should be considered as important in exercise programs for patients with axSpA.",2020,"No differences were seen between the groups at 12 months.

407,32352803,"Condensing parent training: A randomized trial comparing the efficacy of a briefer, more intensive version of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (I-PCIT).","OBJECTIVE


The current study examined the comparative efficacy of a more intensive version of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (I-PCIT; 5 days/week over 2 weeks) versus a time-limited weekly PCIT format (1 day/week over 10 weeks) in treating early childhood externalizing behavior problems.
METHOD


Using a randomized trial design, 60 young children (mean age [ M age ] = 4.33 years; 65% male; 85% Latinx) with clinically elevated levels of externalizing behavior problems and their parents were assigned to either I-PCIT ( n  = 30) or time-limited PCIT ( n  = 30). Families completed pre-, post-, and follow-up assessments 6-9 months following treatment completion. Parents completed measures of child behavior, discipline practices, and parenting stress. Observational data on child behavior and parenting were also collected.
RESULTS


Noninferiority and multivariate repeated-measures analyses indicated comparable improvements across 6 out of 7 observed and parent-reported outcomes, including parenting skills, discipline practices, and child externalizing behavior problems at posttreatment. Comparable treatment gains remained at follow-up, with the caveat that parents in time-limited PCIT reported lower externalizing behavior problems compared with I-PCIT, although both groups were still significantly better compared with pretreatment. Lastly, moderation analyses indicated that parents experiencing high levels of stress benefited more from I-PCIT in terms of decreasing child externalizing behavior compared with time-limited PCIT.
CONCLUSIONS


I-PCIT appears to be a viable treatment option for families, especially those experiencing high levels of stress, in terms of targeting early externalizing behavior problems within a short period of time. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).",2020,"RESULTS

408,32352828,Beyond language: Impacts of shared reading on parenting stress and early parent-child relational health.,"This study examined the interrelated and longitudinal impacts of parent-child shared book reading, parenting stress, and early relational health, as measured by both parental warmth and parent sensitivity, from infancy to toddlerhood. To extend findings from previous studies of collateral effects that have been conducted in parenting interventions, we examined parenting behaviors in a broader context to determine whether shared book reading would confer collateral benefits to the parent and parent-child relationship beyond those expected (i.e., language and literacy). It was hypothesized that positive parent-child interactions, such as shared reading, would have positive impacts on parent outcomes such as parenting stress, parental warmth, and sensitivity. The sample consisted of 293 low-income mothers and their children who participated in a randomized controlled trial. Shared book reading, parenting stress, and parental warmth were assessed when children were 6 and 18 months old. We computed a series of cross-lagged structural equation models to examine longitudinal interrelations among these three factors. Results indicated that shared book reading at 6 months was associated with increases in observed and reported parental warmth and observed sensitivity and decreases in parenting stress at 18 months, controlling for baseline risk factors and treatment group status. These findings suggest that early parent-child book reading can have positive collateral impacts on parents' stress and the parent-child relationship over time.

409,32348101,Diosmin 600 in adjunction to rivaroxaban reduces the risk of the post-thrombotic syndrome after femoropopliteal deep vein thrombosis: the results of RIDILOTT DVT study.,"BACKGROUND


To assess the efficacy and safety of long-term diosmin 600 therapy added to rivaroxaban and elastic compression stockings (ECS) in patients with femoropopliteal deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
METHODS


This single-center, open-label randomized clinical trial RIDILOTT DVT enrolled patients with their first femoropopliteal DVT confirmed by duplex ultrasound scan (DUS). Participants were randomly allocated to the control group (standard treatment with rivaroxaban for six months and ECS for 12 months) or the experimental group (standard treatment with the additional use of diosmin 600 mg once daily for 12 months). Patients were followed for 12 months. The primary outcome was post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), according to the Villalta score (≥5). The secondary outcomes were deep vein recanalization, chronic venous disease (CVD) progression, the severity of PTS (Villalta), and CVD (VCSS), quality of life (CIVIQ-20), venous thromboembolism recurrence, and adverse event (AE).
RESULTS


Ninety patients were randomized (45 per group). There were 56 men and 34 women with a mean age of 57.8±13.4 years, and 69% had clinically unprovoked DVT. PTS frequency at 12 months was significantly lower (8.9% vs. 48.9%) in the experimental group compared with control one (relative risk, 0.14; 95% Confidential Interval, 0.04-0.43, p<0,001). Adding diosmin 600 was associated with quicker and complete vein recanalization, lower CVD progression rate, and lower Villalta, VCSS, and CIVIQ-20 scores. There was no difference in recurrent DVT or AE.

The sample consisted of 105 children (5-8 years old) that were divided into three groups ( n  = 35) according to the anaesthetic technique: conventional anaesthesia (CA); vibrational anaesthesia (VBA); computer-controlled local anaesthesia delivery (CCLAD). The outcomes were self-perception of pain (Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale - WBF; Numerical Rating Scale - NRS); disruptive behaviour (Face, Legg, Activity, Cry, Consolability Scale - FLACC); anxiety (Corah's Dental Anxiety Scale; modified Venham Picture test - VPTm) and physiological parameters (blood pressure - systolic - SBP and diastolic - DBP; heart rate - HR; oxygen saturation - SpO2; respiratory rate - RR). Data were statistically analysed with Kruskall-Wallis test and ANOVA for repeated measures with Tukey post hoc test ( α  = 0.05). Results:  All the patients exhibited the same level of dental anxiety at baseline (Corah's Dental Anxiety Scale). There was no difference in self-perception pain, irrespective the evaluation tool used (WBF -  p  = .864; VAS -  p  = .761).

411,32348263,Effect of an mHealth Intervention Using a Pedometer App With Full In-Person Counseling on Body Composition of Overweight Adults: Randomized Weight Loss Trial.,"BACKGROUND


In clinical practice, it is difficult to convey the benefits of sustained physical activity to adult patients with excess weight or obesity. For this purpose, a goal-setting walking prescription may be an effective strategy.
OBJECTIVE


This study aimed to determine the efficacy of the intervention of a pedometer app in setting a goal to reach 10,000 steps per day in adults.
METHODS


Overweight adults (n=98; mean body mass index 32.53 [SD 4.92] kg/m2) were randomized to one of two conditions (control or intervention). Both groups downloaded a pedometer app that recorded their daily step counts and were given a daily walking goal of 10,000 steps. Subjects participated in a 24-week in-person behavioral weight control program and were asked to monitor their daily levels using the pedometer app. Baseline data were recorded and followed up weekly. Only the intervention group had structured information delivery, a personalized physical activity prescription, and follow-up on number of steps per day.
RESULTS


The results show that regardless of sex or age, prescribing walking increased the number of steps per day by 4806 step on average (standardized beta coefficient=-0.813, SE=427.586, t=-11.242, P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS


These results could have implications for improving self-monitoring in overweight adults during periods of weight loss. Health professionals should analyze the implementation of tools that permit them to prescribe, follow up, and encourage the achievement of a goal of physical activity in overweight or obese patients.

412,32348267,Pragmatic Strategy Empowering Paramedics to Assess Low-Risk Trauma Patients With the Canadian C-Spine Rule and Selectively Transport Them Without Immobilization: Study Protocol for a Stepped-Wedge Cluster Randomized Trial.,"BACKGROUND


Each year, half a million patients with a potential neck (c-spine) injury are transported to Ontario emergency departments (EDs). Less than 1.0% (1/100) of these patients have a neck bone fracture. Even less (1/200, 0.5%) have a spinal cord injury or nerve damage. Currently, paramedics transport all trauma victims (with or without an injury) by ambulance using a backboard, cervical collar, and head immobilizers. Importantly, prolonged immobilization is often unnecessary; it causes patient discomfort and pain, decreases community access to paramedics, contributes to ED crowding, and is very costly. We therefore developed the Canadian C-Spine Rule (CCR) for alert and stable trauma patients. This decision rule helps ED physicians and triage nurses to safely and selectively remove immobilization, without x-rays and missed injury. We successfully taught Ottawa paramedics to use the CCR in the field in a single-center study.
OBJECTIVE


This study aimed to improve patient care and health system efficiency and outcomes by allowing paramedics to assess eligible low-risk trauma patients with the CCR and selectively transport them without immobilization to the ED.
METHODS


We propose a pragmatic stepped-wedge cluster randomized design with health economic evaluation, designed collaboratively with knowledge users. Our 36-month study will consist of a 12-month setup and training period (year 1), followed by the stepped-wedge trial (year 2) and a 12-month period for study completion, analyses, and knowledge translation. A total of 12 Ontario paramedic services of various sizes distributed across the province will be randomly allocated to one of three sequences. Paramedic services in each sequence will cross from the control condition (usual care) to the intervention condition (CCR implementation) at intervals of 3 months until all communities have crossed to the intervention. Data will be collected on all eligible patients in each paramedic service for a total duration of 12 months. A major strength of our design is that each community will have implemented the CCR by the end of the study.
RESULTS


Interim results are expected in December 2019 and final results in 2020. If this multicenter trial is successful, we expect the Ontario Ministry of Health will recommend that paramedics evaluate all eligible patients with the CCR in the Province of Ontario.
CONCLUSIONS


We conservatively estimate that in Ontario, more than 60% of all eligible trauma patients (300,000 annually) could be transported safely and comfortably, without c-spine immobilization devices. This will significantly reduce patient pain and discomfort, paramedic intervention times, and ED length of stay, thereby improving access to paramedics and ED care. This could be achieved rapidly and with lower health care costs compared with current practices (possible cost saving of Can $36 [US $25] per immobilization or Can $10,656,000 [US $7,335,231] per year).

413,32348270,Usability Study of a Mobile Health Intervention System for Women With Coronary Heart Disease.,"BACKGROUND


Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death and disability among American women. The prevalence of CHD is expected to increase by more than 40% by 2035. In 2015, the estimated cost of caring for patients with CHD was US $182 billion in the United States; hospitalizations accounted for more than half of the costs. Compared with men, women with CHD or those who have undergone coronary revascularization have up to 30% more rehospitalizations within 30 days and up to 1 year. Center-based cardiac rehabilitation is the gold standard of care after an acute coronary event, but few women attend these valuable programs. Effective home-based interventions for improving cardiovascular health among women with CHD are vital for addressing this gap in care.
OBJECTIVE


The ubiquity of mobile phones has made mobile health (mHealth) behavioral interventions a viable option to improve healthy behaviors of both women and men with CHD. First, this study aimed to examine the usability of a prototypic mHealth intervention designed specifically for women with CHD (herein referred to as HerBeat). Second, we examined the influence of HerBeat on selected health behaviors (self-efficacy for diet, exercise, and managing chronic illness) and psychological (perceived stress and depressive symptoms) characteristics of the participants.
METHODS


Using a single-group, pretest, posttest design, 10 women participated in the 12-week usability study. Participants were provided a smartphone and a smartwatch on which the HerBeat app was installed. Using a Web portal dashboard, a health coach monitored participants' ecological momentary assessment data, their behavioral data, and their heart rate and step count. Participants then completed a 12-week follow-up assessment.
RESULTS


All 10 women (age: mean 64.4 years, SD 6.3 years) completed the study. The usability and acceptability of HerBeat were good, with a mean system usability score of 83.60 (SD 16.3). The participants demonstrated statistically significant improvements in waist circumference (P=.048), weight (P=.02), and BMI (P=.01). Furthermore, depressive symptoms, measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, significantly improved from baseline (P=.04).
CONCLUSIONS


The mHealth prototype was feasible and usable for women with CHD. Participants provided data that were useful for further development of HerBeat. The mHealth intervention is expected to help women with CHD self-manage their health behaviors .

414,32348280,Pedometer-Guided Physical Activity Intervention in Obese Pregnant Women: Randomized Feasibility Study (The Fit MUM Study).,"BACKGROUND


Obesity in pregnancy is a growing problem worldwide, with excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) occurring in the majority of pregnancies. This significantly increases risks to mother and child. A major contributor to both prepregnancy obesity and excessive GWG is physical inactivity; however, past interventions targeting maternal weight gain and activity levels during the antenatal period have been ineffective in women who are already overweight. Pedometer-guided activity may offer a novel solution to increasing activity levels in this population.
OBJECTIVE


This initial feasibility randomized controlled trial aimed to test a pedometer-based intervention to increase activity and reduce excessive GWG in pregnant women.
METHODS


We supplied 30 pregnant women with obesity a Fitbit Zip pedometer and randomized them into 1 of 3 groups: control (pedometer only), app (pedometer synced to patients' personal smartphone, with self-monitoring of activity), or app-coach (addition of a health coach-delivered behavioral change program). Feasibility outcomes included participant compliance with wearing pedometers (days with missing pedometer data), data syncing, and data integrity. Activity outcomes (step counts and active minutes) were analyzed using linear mixed models and generalized estimating equations.
RESULTS


A total of 30 participants were recruited within a 10-week period, with a dropout rate of 10% (3/30, 2 withdrawals and 1 stillbirth); 27 participants thus completed the study. Mean BMI in all groups was ≥35 kg/m2. Mean (SD) percentage of missing data days were 23.4% (20.6%), 39.5% (32.4%), and 21.1% (16.0%) in control, app group, and app-coach group patients, respectively. Estimated mean baseline activity levels were 14.5 active min/day and 5455 steps/day, with no significant differences found in activity levels between groups, with mean daily step counts in all groups remaining in the sedentary (5000 steps/day) or low activity (5000-7499 steps/day) categories for the entire study duration. There was a mean decrease of 7.8 steps/day for each increase in gestation day over the study period (95% CI 2.91 to 12.69, P=.002).
CONCLUSIONS


Activity data syncing with a personal smartphone is feasible in a cohort of pregnant women with obesity. However, our results do not support a future definitive study in its present form. Recruitment and retention rates were adequate, as was activity data syncing to participants' smartphones. A follow up interventional trial seeking to reduce GWG and improve activity in this population must focus on improving compliance with activity data recording and behavioral interventions delivered.

415,32348281,Mind-body physical activity program for chronic pain with or without a Digital-Monitoring-Device: Proof-of-concept feasibility RCT.,"BACKGROUND


Chronic pain is associated with poor physical and emotional functioning. Nonpharmacological interventions can help but improvements are small and not sustained. Prior clinical trials do not follow recommendations to comprehensively target objective and performance-based physical function in addition to self-reported physical function.
OBJECTIVE


To establish feasibility benchmarks and explore improvements in physical (self-report, performance based and objective) and emotional function, pain outcomes and coping through a pilot RCT of a mind-body physical activity program (GetActive) with and without a digital monitoring device (GetActive-Fitbit) which were iteratively refined through mixed methods.
METHODS


Patients with chronic pain were randomized to GetActive (N=41) or GetActive-Fitbit (N=41) programs, which combine relaxation, cognitive-behavioral, and physical restoration skills and were delivered in person. They completed in-person assessments before and after the intervention. Performance based function was assessed with the 6-minute walk test and step-count was measured with an ActiGraph.
RESULTS


Feasibility benchmarks (e.g., recruitment, acceptability, credibility, therapist adherence, adherence to home-practice, ActiGraph wear, and client satisfaction) were good-to-excellent, and similar in both programs. Within each program, we observed improvement on the 6-minute walk test (+41 meters, P<.001, ES=.99 for GetActive; +50 meters, P<.001, ES=.85 for GetActive-Fitbit) and self-reported physical function (P=.001, ES=.62 for GetActive; P=.024, ES=.38 for GetActive-Fitbit). Mean step count increased only among sedentary patients (+874 steps GetActive; +867 steps for GetActive-Fitbit). Emotional function, pain intensity, pain coping and mindfulness also improved in both groups. Participants rated themselves as ""much improved"" at the end of the program, and those in GetActive-Fitbit noted that the Fitbit ""greatly helped"" with increasing their activity.
CONCLUSIONS


These preliminary findings support a fully-powered efficacy trial of the two programs against an education control group. We present a model for successfully using IMMPACT criteria for comprehensive assessment of physical function and following evidence-based models to maximize feasibility prior to formal efficacy testing.

417,32348306,Two-year efficacy of varenicline tartrate and counselling for inpatient smoking cessation (STOP study): A randomized controlled clinical trial.,"INTRODUCTION


Varenicline tartrate is superior for smoking cessation to other tobacco cessation therapies by 52 weeks, in the outpatient setting. We aimed to evaluate the long-term (104 week) efficacy following a standard course of inpatient-initiated varenicline tartrate plus Quitline-counselling compared to Quitline-counselling alone.
METHODS


Adult patients (n = 392, 20-75 years) admitted with a smoking-related illnesses to one of three hospitals, were randomised to receive either 12-weeks of varenicline tartrate (titrated from 0.5mg daily to 1mg twice-daily) plus Quitline-counselling, (n = 196) or Quitline-counselling alone, (n = 196), with continuous abstinence from smoking assessed at 104 weeks.
RESULTS


A total of 1959 potential participants were screened for eligibility between August 2008 and December 2011. The proportion of participants who remained continuously abstinent (intention-to-treat) at 104 weeks were significantly greater in the varenicline tartrate plus counselling arm (29.2% n = 56) compared to counselling alone (18.8% n = 36; p = 0.02; odds ratio 1.78; 95%CI 1.10 to 2.86, p = 0.02). Twenty-two deaths occurred during the 104 week study (n = 10 for varenicline tartrate plus counselling and n = 12 for Quitline-counselling alone). All of these participants had known or developed underlying co-morbidities.
CONCLUSIONS


This is the first study to examine the efficacy and safety of varenicline tartrate over 104 weeks within any setting.

418,32348359,"Predictive validity in middle childhood of short tests of early childhood development used in large scale studies compared to the Bayley-III, the Family Care Indicators, height-for-age, and stunting: A longitudinal study in Bogota, Colombia.","There is increasing global commitment to establish early childhood interventions that promote the development of the millions of disadvantaged children in low- and middle-income countries not reaching their developmental potential. However, progress is hindered by the lack of valid developmental tests feasible for use at large scale. Consequently, there is an urgent need for such tests. Whilst screeners and single-domain tests ('short tests') are used as alternatives, their predictive validity in these circumstances is unknown. A longitudinal study in Bogota, Colombia began in 2011 when 1,311 children ages 6-42 months were given the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III) by psychologists and randomized to receive one of two batteries of short tests under survey conditions. Concurrent validity of the short tests with the Bayley-III ('gold standard') was reported. In 2016, at 6-8 years, 940 of these children were given tests of IQ (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, WISC-V) and school achievement (arithmetic, reading, and vocabulary) by psychologists. We compared the ability of the short tests, the Family Care Indicators (FCI), height-for-age, stunting (median height-for-age <-2 SD), and the Bayley-III to predict IQ and achievement in middle childhood. Predictive validity increased with age for all tests, and cognition and language were usually the highest scales. At 6-18 months, all tests had trivial predictive ability. Thereafter, the Bayley-III had the highest predictive validity, but the Denver Developmental Screening Test was the most feasible and valid short test and could be used with little validity loss compared with the Bayley-III. The MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory at 19-30 months and the FCI under 31 months predicted IQ and school achievement as well as the Bayley-III. The FCI had higher predictive validity than stunting and height-for-age, and could be added to stunting for use as a population-based indicator of child development.",2020,"The FCI had higher predictive validity than stunting and height-for-age, and could be added to stunting for use as a population-based indicator of child development.","['Bogota, Colombia began in 2011 when 1,311 children ages 6-42 months were given the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development']",[],"['trivial predictive ability', 'IQ (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, WISC-V) and school achievement (arithmetic, reading, and vocabulary', 'Predictive validity']","[{'cui': 'C3245499', 'cui_str': 'Colombia'}, {'cui': 'C0439659', 'cui_str': 'Origins'}, {'cui': 'C0008059', 'cui_str': 'Child'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0332177', 'cui_str': 'Monthly'}, {'cui': 'C1947971', 'cui_str': 'Give'}, {'cui': 'C0175659', 'cui_str': 'Scale'}, {'cui': 'C0021270', 'cui_str': 'Infant'}, {'cui': 'C0682053', 'cui_str': 'Toddler'}, {'cui': 'C0018271', 'cui_str': 'Growth and Development'}]",[],"[{'cui': 'C0085732', 'cui_str': 'Ability'}, {'cui': 'C0204457', 'cui_str': 'Wechsler intelligence scale for children'}, {'cui': 'C0700132', 'cui_str': 'Academic Achievement'}, {'cui': 'C0034754', 'cui_str': 'Reading'}, {'cui': 'C0042926', 'cui_str': 'Vocabulary'}, {'cui': 'C0042283', 'cui_str': 'Validity (Epidemiology)'}]",1311.0,0.0200179,"The FCI had higher predictive validity than stunting and height-for-age, and could be added to stunting for use as a population-based indicator of child development.","[{'ForeName': 'Marta', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Rubio-Codina', 'Affiliation': 'Social Protection and Health Division, Inter-American Development Bank, Washington, D.C., United States of America.'}, {'ForeName': 'Sally', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Grantham-McGregor', 'Affiliation': 'Faculty of Population Health Sciences, Institute of Child Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom.'}]",PloS one,['10.1371/journal.pone.0231317']
419,32348374,Surface respiratory electromyography and dyspnea in acute heart failure patients.,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES


Dyspnea is the most common symptom among hospitalized patients with heart failure (HF) but besides dyspnea questionnaires (which reflect the subjective patient sensation and are not fully validated in HF) there are no measurable physiological variables providing objective assessment of dyspnea in a setting of acute HF patients. Studies performed in respiratory patients suggest that the measurement of electromyographic (EMG) activity of the respiratory muscles with surface electrodes correlates well with dyspnea. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that respiratory muscles EMG activity is a potential marker of dyspnea severity in acute HF patients.
METHODS


Prospective and descriptive pilot study carried out in 25 adult patients admitted for acute HF. Measurements were carried out with a cardio-respiratory portable polygraph including EMG surface electrodes for measuring the activity of main (diaphragm) and accessory (scalene and pectoralis minor) respiratory muscles. Dyspnea sensation was assessed by means of the Likert 5 questionnaire. Data were recorded during 3 min of spontaneous breathing and after breathing at maximum effort for several cycles for normalizing data. An index to quantify the activity of each respiratory muscle was computed. This assessment was carried out within the first 24 h of admission, and at day 2 and 5.
RESULTS


Dyspnea score decreased along the three measured days. Diaphragm and scalene EMG index showed a positive and significant direct relationship with dyspnea score (p<0.001 and p = 0.003 respectively) whereas pectoralis minor muscle did not.
CONCLUSION


In our pilot study, diaphragm and scalene EMG activity was associated with increasing severity of dyspnea. Surface respiratory EMG could be a useful objective tool to improve assessment of dyspnea in acute HF patients.",2020,"Diaphragm and scalene EMG index showed a positive and significant direct relationship with dyspnea score (p<0.001 and p = 0.003 respectively) whereas pectoralis minor muscle did not.

To evaluate impact of baseline systemic dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor use in diabetic macular edema (DME).
PATIENTS AND METHODS


This was a post hoc exploratory analysis of previously completed randomized, controlled clinical trials (VISTA and VIVID) in patients with DME evaluating intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI) every 4 weeks (2q4) or every 8 weeks (2q8) or macular laser photocoagulation.
RESULTS


Overall, a small number of patients (12.2% [n = 35], 9.7% [n = 28], and 15.4% [n = 44]) in the laser control, 2q4, and 2q8 groups reported baseline DPP-4 inhibitor use. There were no differences in changes from baseline in best-corrected visual acuity, central subfield thickness, or rates of 2-or-greater-step improvement in Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale score based on DPP-4 inhibitor use within each treatment group.
CONCLUSION

422,32348699,How short is too short? A randomised controlled trial evaluating short-term existential behavioural therapy for informal caregivers of palliative patients.,"BACKGROUND


Informal caregivers of palliative patients show higher levels of depression and distress compared with the general population. Fegg's (2013) existential behavioural therapy was shortened to two individual 1-h sessions (short-term existential behavioural therapy).
AIM


Testing the effectiveness of sEBT on psychological symptoms of informal caregivers in comparison with active control.
DESIGN


Randomised controlled trial.
SETTING/PARTICIPANTS


Informal caregivers of palliative in-patients.
METHODS


The primary outcome was depression; secondary outcomes were anxiety, subjective distress and minor mental disorders, positive and negative affect, satisfaction with life, quality of life and direct health care costs. General linear mixed models allow several measurements per participant and change over time. Reasons for declining the intervention were investigated by Rosenstock's Health Belief Model.
RESULTS


Overall inclusion rate was 41.0%. Data of 157 caregivers were available (63.1% females; mean age: 54.6 years, standard deviation (SD): 14.1); 127 participants were included in the main analysis. Participation in sEBT or active control was not significantly associated with post-treatment depression. Outcomes showed prevailingly significant association with time of investigation. Self-efficacy, scepticism of benefit of the intervention, belief of better coping alone and support by family and friends were significant factors in declining participation in the randomised controlled trial.
CONCLUSION


Inclusion rate was tripled compared with a previously evaluated longer EBT group intervention. By shortening the intervention, inclusion rate was traded for effectiveness and the intervention could not impact caregivers' psychological state.

Psychological distress is highly prevalent among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
AIMS


To perform an economic evaluation of a combined screening and treatment program targeting psychological distress in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in comparison with usual care.
DESIGN


Societal costs were collected alongside a cluster randomized controlled trial for 48 weeks. A total of 349 participants were included.
SETTING


Participants were recruited from oncology departments at 16 participating hospitals in the Netherlands.
METHODS


Outcome measures were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and quality-adjusted life-years. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation. Uncertainty was estimated using bootstrapping. Cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated to show uncertainty surrounding the cost-effectiveness estimates. Sensitivity analyses were performed to check robustness of results.
RESULTS


Between treatment arms, no significant differences were found in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score (mean difference: -0.058; 95% confidence interval: -0.13 to 0.011), quality-adjusted life-years (mean difference: 0.042; 95% confidence interval: -0.015 to 0.099), and societal costs (mean difference: -1152; 95% confidence interval: -5058 to 2214). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that the probability of cost-effectiveness was 0.64 and 0.74 at willingness-to-pay values of €0 and €10,000 per point improvement on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, respectively. The probability that the intervention was cost-effective compared to usual care for quality-adjusted life-years was 0.64 and 0.79 at willingness-to-pay values of €0 and €20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively.
CONCLUSION

We investigated the usability of an intravascular temperature management (IVTM) system with neurolept-anesthesia (NLA; droperidol and fentanyl). Single-arm, prospective multicenter trial was carried out in the seven university and the three affiliated hospitals. In the 24 comatose PCAS patients, the target temperature (33.0°C) was rapidly induced and maintained for 24 hours using an IVTM system with NLA. The rewarming speed was 0.1°C/h until 36.5°C and was maintained for 24 hours. The primary end point was the ability to achieve ≤34.0°C for <3 hours after starting cooling, and the secondary end points were the cooling rate, deviation from the target temperature, and adverse events. Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score at 14 days was also evaluated. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS software, using the intention-to-treat data sets. The target temperature of ≤34.0°C was reached by 45 minutes (35-73 minutes) and was within 3 hours in all patients. The cooling rate from 36.4°C to 33.0°C was 2.7°C/h (2.4-3.6°C/h). The temperature of 33.1°C (33.1-33.1°C) and 36.7°C (36.6-36.9°C) for 24 hours each was held during the maintenance and the after rewarming phases, respectively. Temperature deviations >0.2°C from 33.0°C in the maintenance phase occurred once each in two patients. The favorable neurological outcomes (CPC1, 2) were relatively good (50%).

425,32353174,Physical activity and cognition in young onset Parkinson's disease.,"BACKGROUND


A relationship has been observed between physical activity and cognition in Parkinson's disease as well as improvements in cognition after a physical activity intervention. To date, this has not been investigated in young onset Parkinson's disease (YOPD).
OBJECTIVES


The present study had two aims: To examine the baseline relationship between physical activity and cognition in YOPD; and to examine whether a physical activity intervention can improve cognition in YOPD.
METHODS


Two interrelated online studies were conducted. In the first study, 132 participants with YOPD completed self-report measures of physical activity, and objective and subjective measures of cognition. A subset of 38 participants was then randomly allocated to either a six-week physical activity intervention or control condition. Following the intervention, participants repeated the objective and subjective cognitive measures.
RESULTS


No relationship was found between self-reported physical activity and objective cognition; however, there was a relationship between physical activity and subjective cognition. Similarly, following the intervention subjective improvements were found for concentration, attention, and processing speed, but not memory. Furthermore, medium effect sizes were evident for objective measures of processing speed and small-medium effect sizes for planning and cognitive flexibility, although statistical significance was not reached.
CONCLUSIONS


In this first study investigating physical activity and cognition in YOPD, results suggest that increased physical activity relates to improved processing speed and attention. Replication is recommended with a larger sample size. A longer, more intense physical activity manipulation and utilizing the study's strengths of online recruitment and intervention delivery is also recommended.",2020,"Similarly, following the intervention subjective improvements were found for concentration, attention, and processing speed, but not memory.","['38 participants', ""young onset Parkinson's disease (YOPD"", ""young onset Parkinson's disease"", '132 participants with YOPD completed']","['physical activity intervention', 'six-week physical activity intervention or control condition']","['physical activity and objective cognition', 'Physical activity and cognition', 'physical activity and subjective cognition', 'processing speed and small-medium effect sizes for planning and cognitive flexibility', 'objective and subjective cognitive measures', 'self-report measures of physical activity, and objective and subjective measures of cognition', 'concentration, attention, and processing speed, but not memory']","[{'cui': 'C4275179', 'cui_str': 'Young onset Parkinson disease'}, {'cui': 'C0205197', 'cui_str': 'Complete'}]","[{'cui': 'C0015259', 'cui_str': 'Exercise'}, {'cui': 'C0184661', 'cui_str': 'Procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0439230', 'cui_str': 'week'}, {'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}, {'cui': 'C0009647', 'cui_str': 'Conditioning'}]","[{'cui': 'C0015259', 'cui_str': 'Exercise'}, {'cui': 'C0018017', 'cui_str': 'Goal'}, {'cui': 'C0009240', 'cui_str': 'Cognitive Function'}, {'cui': 'C0439655', 'cui_str': 'Subjective'}, {'cui': 'C1522240', 'cui_str': 'Process'}, {'cui': 'C0025611', 'cui_str': 'Methamphetamine'}, {'cui': 'C0547044', 'cui_str': 'Lesser'}, {'cui': 'C0009458', 'cui_str': 'Communications Media'}, {'cui': 'C1280500', 'cui_str': 'Effect'}, {'cui': 'C0456389', 'cui_str': 'Size'}, {'cui': 'C0032074', 'cui_str': 'Cognitive function: planning'}, {'cui': 'C0242808', 'cui_str': 'Flexibility'}, {'cui': 'C0079809', 'cui_str': 'Measure'}, {'cui': 'C2700446', 'cui_str': 'Self-reported'}, {'cui': 'C0004268', 'cui_str': 'Attention'}, {'cui': 'C0582591', 'cui_str': 'Processing speed'}, {'cui': 'C0025260', 'cui_str': 'Memory function'}]",132.0,0.0152447,"Similarly, following the intervention subjective improvements were found for concentration, attention, and processing speed, but not memory.","[{'ForeName': 'Karen J', 'Initials': 'KJ', 'LastName': 'Biddiscombe', 'Affiliation': 'School of Psychology and Public Health, La Trobe University, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Ben', 'Initials': 'B', 'LastName': 'Ong', 'Affiliation': 'School of Psychology and Public Health, La Trobe University, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Pawel', 'Initials': 'P', 'LastName': 'Kalinowski', 'Affiliation': 'Cogstate, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kerryn E', 'Initials': 'KE', 'LastName': 'Pike', 'Affiliation': 'School of Psychology and Public Health, La Trobe University, Victoria, Australia.'}]",Acta neurologica Scandinavica,['10.1111/ane.13256']
426,32353206,Effects of individual pelvic floor muscle training vs individual training progressing to group training vs group training alone in women with stress urinary incontinence: A randomized clinical trial.,"AIMS


To assess the effects of individual pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training vs individual training (IT) progressing to group training (GT) vs group-only training in women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI).
METHODS


Randomized controlled and pragmatic clinical trials with 90 women with SUI. Participants were randomly allocated to one of three groups: IT, GT, or four individual sessions progressing to group training (IPGT). The intervention included 12 sessions, once a week, with direct supervision by a physical therapist.
PRIMARY OUTCOME


severity according to the King's Health Questionnaire.
SECONDARY OUTCOMES


PFM function by palpation and manometer, bladder and exercise diaries, PFM training adherence, and self-efficacy. Reassessments were conducted at the end of the intervention, 3 and 6 months after the intervention. Intra- and intergroup analysis for all outcomes was performed using a multivariate analysis of variance. In the mixed-effects model used, the evaluation groups and times and their interactions were considered. A significance level of 5% was adopted.
RESULTS


After the intervention, the severity measure improved in all three groups (P < .001), without difference between them (P = .56). The benefits of the intervention were maintained 3 and 6 months after the end of the supervised training (P < .001). The IPGT group had a significant improvement in PFM function when compared to the other groups posttreatment (P < .001).
CONCLUSION

Asthmatic patients may benefit from exercise training, although the effects of a combined aerobic and resistance training program are still poorly investigated in children and adolescents.
OBJECTIVE


To analyze the effects of a combined exercise training (resistance and aerobic) program on aerobic fitness, lung function, asthma control and quality of life in a group of mild-moderate asthmatic children with exercise symptoms.
METHODS


This was a 12-week randomized controlled trial including children and adolescents diagnosed with mild-moderate asthma and presenting exercise-induced symptoms. The intervention group (IG) performed the exercise training (resistance and aerobic) 3 days/week, for 60 minutes. The control group (CG) followed routine clinical orientations. The main outcomes were cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, lung function, quality of life, asthma control, and functional tests after 3 months of the intervention.
RESULTS


Fifty-three patients (IG = 25 and CG = 28) with a mean age of 11.5 ± 2.6 years were included. No significant differences were found between groups regarding lung function, asthma control, quality of life, and functional tests. Ventilatory equivalent for oxygen consumption at ventilatory threshold (P = .025;  η   p   2     = 0.083), peak oxygen consumption (P = .008;  η   p   2     = 0.116) and test duration (P = .014;  η   p   2     = 0.1) presented greater improvements in the IG. In addition, improvements were observed in leg press (P < .001;  η   p   2     = 0.36), hamstring curl (P = .001;  η   p   2     = 0.217), high row (P = .003;  η   p   2     = .167), low row (P = .009;  η   p   2     = 0.128) and quadriceps leg extension (P = .015;  η   p   2     = 0.108) in the IG.

428,32353246,Effects of Solriamfetol on Quality of Life Measures From a 12-Week Phase 3 Randomized Trial.,"RATIONALE


Excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnea is associated with substantial burden of illness.
OBJECTIVE


To assess solriamfetol, a dopamine/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, treatment effects on daily functioning, health-related quality of life, and work productivity in participants with obstructive sleep apnea and excessive daytime sleepiness as additional outcomes in a 12-week phase 3 trial (www.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02348606).
METHODS


Participants (N=476) were randomized to solriamfetol 37.5, 75, 150, or 300 milligrams, or placebo. Outcome measures included Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire short version, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire for Specific Health Problem, and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey version 2. A mixed-effects model with repeated measures was used for comparisons to placebo.
RESULTS


Demographics, baseline disease characteristics, daily functioning, health-related quality of life, and work productivity were similar across groups. At week 12, increased functioning and decreased impairment were observed with solriamfetol 150 and 300 milligrams (mean difference from placebo [95% confidence interval]): Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire total score (1.22 [0.57, 1.88]) and (1.47 [0.80, 2.13], respectively), overall work impairment (-11.67 [-19.66, -3.69] and -11.75 [-19.93, -3.57], respectively) activity impairment (-10.42 [-16.37, -4.47] and -10.51 [-16.59, -4.43], respectively), physical component summary (2.07 [0.42, 3.72] and 1.91 [0.22, 3.59], respectively), and mental component summary (150 mg only: 2.05 [0.14, 3.96]). Common adverse events were headache, nausea, decreased appetite, and anxiety.

429,32353535,High-definition Chromoendoscopy Superior to High-definition White-light Endoscopy in Surveillance of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in a Randomized Trial.,"BACKGROUND


& Aims: There is debate over the optimal method for colonoscopic surveillance of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. Guidelines recommend chromoendoscopy, but the value of chromoendoscopy in high-definition colonoscopy has not been proven. Furthermore, the value of random biopsies is controversial.
METHODS


We performed a prospective study of 305 patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's colitis referred for surveillance colonoscopy at a university hospital in Sweden, from March 2011 through April 2016. Patients randomly assigned to a group that received high-definition chromoendoscopy with indigo carmine (HD-CE, n=152), collection of 32 random biopsies, and targeted biopsies or polypectomies or to a group that received high-definition white light endoscopy (HD-WLE, n=153), collection of 32 random biopsies, and targeted biopsies or polypectomies. The primary endpoint was number of patients with dysplastic lesions.
RESULTS


Dysplastic lesions were detected in 17 patients with HD-CE and 7 patients with HD-WLE (P =.032). Dysplasias in random biopsies (n=9760) were detected in 9 patients: 6 (3.9%) in the HD-CE group and 3 (2.0%) in the HD-WLE group (P=.72). Of the 9 patients with dysplasia, 3 patients (33%) had primary sclerosing cholangitis-only 18% of patients (54/305) included in the study had primary sclerosing cholangitis. The number of dysplastic lesions per 10 min of withdrawal time was 0.066 with HD-CE and 0.027 with HD-WLE (P=.056).
CONCLUSION


In a randomized trial, we found HD-CE with collection of random biopsies to be superior to HD-WLE with random biopsies for detection of dysplasia per colonoscopy. These results support the use of chromoendoscopy for surveillance of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.

430,32353536,Agreement of Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography with Fluorescein Leakage in Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration: Post Hoc Analysis of the HARBOR Study.,"PURPOSE


To evaluate the agreement between detection of activity of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and spectral domain (SD)- optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the HARBOR study. Most retina specialists rely on OCT to guide treatment decisions in neovascular AMD. However, OCT may not always detect exudative activity. Traditionally, FFA was frequently performed in clinical practice, but its use has diminished due to reliance on OCT.
DESIGN


Retrospective Post Hoc Analysis of Prospective Clinical Trial (HARBOR; clinicaltrials.gov identifier, NCT00891735) PARTICIPANTS: Baseline to Month 24 data from all randomized study eyes in HARBOR with both FFA and SD-OCT data were analyzed for 1) Evidence of CNV activity on SD- OCT (presence of subretinal fluid, intraretinal fluid, and/or cystoid spaces); 2) Evidence of CNV activity on FFA identified by the presence of leakage 3) Cross tabulation of CNV activity identified by FFA and SD-OCT by office visit.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE


The percent agreement between FFA and SD-OCT in detecting CNV activity and sensitivity and specificity of SD-OCT to detect fluorescein leakage in neovascular AMD using FFA as the reference standard.
RESULTS


At baseline, 1094 cases (99.9%) had agreement between SD-OCT and FFA in detecting CNV activity. By Month 24, of the 779 total active cases the agreement was only 36% (277 cases). By month 24 most cases (n= 452, 58%) had evidence of CNV activity on SD-OCT only, while 6% of cases (n=50) had CNV activity identified by FFA only. At screening and months 3, 6, 12, and 24, 92-100% of cases identified by FFA only were occult CNV lesions. Using FFA as the reference standard, the sensitivity and specificity of SD-OCT in detecting CNV activity was 91% (95% CI: 84%, 99%) and 13% (95% CI: 4%, 22%).
CONCLUSION


SD-OCT alone can be relied upon for detecting CNV activity while monitoring eyes with neovascular AMD.

431,32353544,Medication treatment for opioid use disorder in expectant mothers (MOMs): Design considerations for a pragmatic randomized trial comparing extended-release and daily buprenorphine formulations.,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) in pregnant women has increased significantly in recent years. Maintaining these women on sublingual (SL) buprenorphine (BUP) is an evidence-based practice but BUP-SL is associated with several disadvantages that an extended-release (XR) BUP formulation could eliminate. The National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) is conducting an intent-to-treat, two-arm, open-label, pragmatic randomized controlled trial, Medication treatment for Opioid-dependent expectant Mothers (MOMs), to compare mother and infant outcomes of pregnant women with OUD treated with BUP-XR, relative to BUP-SL. A second aim is to determine the relative economic value of utilizing BUP-XR. Approximately 300 pregnant women with an estimated gestational age (EGA) of 6-30 weeks, recruited from 12 sites, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to BUP-XR or BUP-SL, balancing on site, EGA, and BUP-SL status (taking/not taking) at the time of randomization. Participants will be provided with study medication and attend weekly medication visits through 12 months postpartum. Participants will be invited to participate in two sub-studies to evaluate the: 1) mechanisms by which BUP-XR may improve mother and infant outcomes; and 2) effects of prenatal exposure to BUP-XR versus BUP-SL on infant neurodevelopment. This paper describes the key design decisions for the main trial made during protocol development. This Investigational New Drug (IND) trial uniquely uses pragmatic features where feasible in order to maximize external validity, hence increasing the potential to inform clinical practice guidelines and address multiple knowledge gaps for treatment of this patient population.",2020,"Approximately 300 pregnant women with an estimated gestational age (EGA) of 6-30 weeks, recruited from 12 sites, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to BUP-XR or BUP-SL, balancing on site, EGA, and BUP-SL status (taking/not taking) at the time of randomization.","['expectant mothers (MOMs', 'Approximately 300 pregnant women with an estimated gestational age (EGA) of 6-30\u202fweeks, recruited from 12 sites', 'pregnant women with OUD treated with BUP-XR, relative to BUP-SL', 'pregnant women']","['sublingual (SL) buprenorphine (BUP', 'buprenorphine formulations', 'prenatal exposure to BUP-XR versus BUP-SL']",[],"[{'cui': 'C0026591', 'cui_str': 'Mother'}, {'cui': 'C1442163', 'cui_str': 'MoM'}, {'cui': 'C0332232', 'cui_str': 'Approximate'}, {'cui': 'C4319604', 'cui_str': '300'}, {'cui': 'C0033011', 'cui_str': 'Pregnant woman'}, {'cui': 'C0750572', 'cui_str': 'Estimated'}, {'cui': 'C0017504', 'cui_str': 'Fetal gestational age'}, {'cui': 'C0439230', 'cui_str': 'week'}, {'cui': 'C0205145', 'cui_str': 'Site'}, {'cui': 'C0332293', 'cui_str': 'Treated with'}, {'cui': 'C3875154', 'cui_str': 'Relative to'}]","[{'cui': 'C0001565', 'cui_str': 'Sublingual route'}, {'cui': 'C0006405', 'cui_str': 'Buprenorphine'}, {'cui': 'C0524527', 'cui_str': 'Pharmaceutical Formulation'}, {'cui': 'C0033052', 'cui_str': 'Antenatal care'}, {'cui': 'C0332157', 'cui_str': 'Exposure to'}]",[],300.0,0.0591114,"Approximately 300 pregnant women with an estimated gestational age (EGA) of 6-30 weeks, recruited from 12 sites, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to BUP-XR or BUP-SL, balancing on site, EGA, and BUP-SL status (taking/not taking) at the time of randomization.","[{'ForeName': 'Theresa', 'Initials': 'T', 'LastName': 'Winhusen', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, 3131 Harvey Avenue, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA; Center for Addiction Research, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, 3131 Harvey Avenue, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.

432,32353573,Sick days in general hospital patients two years after brief alcohol intervention: Secondary outcomes from a randomized controlled trial.,"Little is known about the long-term impact of brief alcohol interventions (BAIs) on health and on sick days in particular. The aim was to investigate whether BAIs reduce sick days in general hospital patients over two years, and whether effects depend on how BAIs are delivered; either through in-person counseling (PE) or computer-generated written feedback (CO). To investigate this, secondary outcome data from a three-arm randomized controlled trial with 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-month follow-ups were used. The sample included 960 patients (18-64 years) with at-risk alcohol use identified through systematic screening on 13 hospital wards. Patients with particularly severe alcohol problems were excluded. Participants were allocated to PE, CO and assessment only (AO). Both interventions were tailored according to behavior change theory and included three contacts. Self-reported number of sick days in the past 6 months was assessed at all time-points. A zero-inflated negative binomial latent growth model adjusted for socio-demographics, substance use related variables and medical department was calculated. In comparison to AO, PE (OR = 2.18, p = 0.047) and CO (OR = 2.08, p = 0.047) resulted in statistically significant increased odds of reporting no sick days 24 months later. Differences between PE and CO, and concerning sick days when any reported, were non-significant.

434,32353714,Music during image-guided breast biopsy reduces patient anxiety levels.,"PURPOSE


Interventions to decrease anxiety associated with image-guided breast biopsy are needed. Music intervention has been shown to be helpful in other outpatient procedural settings but data are limited regarding its effectiveness in the setting of breast biopsy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether listening to self-selected music during image-guided breast biopsy lowers anxiety.
MATERIALS AND METHODS


This randomized controlled trial was approved by the institutional review board and was HIPAA-compliant. 157 women between 18 and 75 (mean, 49.7 years) years of age, undergoing stereotactic or ultrasound-guided core biopsy, were enrolled in the study and were prospectively randomized to music or usual care. Patients in the music group listened to music of their choice during the biopsy. All patients completed the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) before and after the biopsy. Differences in pre-biopsy and post-biopsy anxiety levels were compared between the two groups using the Mann-Whitney U test.
RESULTS


Baseline trait anxiety scores in the two groups were similar (34.0 music, 31.5 control, p = .11). Patients in both groups showed lower state anxiety levels after the biopsy (45.6 to 34.3 music, 41.0 to 33.8 control, p < .001 for both). Patients who listened to music showed a greater reduction in anxiety (mean decrease 11.2 music, 7.3 control, p = .03). Post-biopsy anxiety levels were similar to normative values for working women in the same age group.

435,32353739,Real time SVD-based clutter filtering using randomized singular value decomposition and spatial downsampling for micro-vessel imaging on a Verasonics ultrasound system.,"Singular value decomposition (SVD)-based clutter filters can robustly reject the tissue clutter as compared with the conventional high pass filter-based clutter filters. However, the computational burden of SVD makes real time SVD-based clutter filtering challenging (e.g. frame rate at least 10-15 Hz with region of interest of about 4 × 4 cm 2 ). Recently, we proposed an acceleration method based on randomized SVD (rSVD) clutter filtering and randomized spatial downsampling, which can significantly reduce the computational complexity without compromising the clutter rejection capability. However, this method has not been implemented on an ultrasound scanner and tested for its performance. In this study, we implement this acceleration method on a Verasonics scanner using a multi-core CPU architecture, and evaluate the selections of the imaging and processing parameters to enable real time micro-vessel imaging. The Blood-to-Clutter Ratio (BCR) performance was evaluated on a Verasonics machine with different settings of parameters such as block size and ensemble size. The demonstration of real time process was implemented on a 12-core CPU (downsampling factor of 12, 12-threads in this study) host computer. The processing time of the rSVD-based clutter filter was less than 30 ms and BCRs were higher than 20 dB as the block size, ensemble size and the rank of tissue clutter subspace were set as 30 × 30, 45 and 26 respectively. We also demonstrate that the micro-vessel imaging frame rate of the proposed architecture can reach approximately 22 Hz when the block size, ensemble size and the rank of tissue clutter subspace were set as 20 × 20 pixels, 45 and 26 respectively (using both images and supplementary videos). The proposed method may be important for real time 2D scanning of tumor microvessels in 3D to select and store the most representative 2D view with most abnormal micro-vessels for better diagnosis.",2020,"The processing time of the rSVD-based clutter filter was less than 30 ms and BCRs were higher than 20 dB as the block size, ensemble size and the rank of tissue clutter subspace were set as 30 × 30, 45 and 26 respectively.",[],[],"['Blood-to-Clutter Ratio (BCR) performance', 'processing time of the rSVD-based clutter filter']",[],[],"[{'cui': 'C0005767', 'cui_str': 'Blood'}, {'cui': 'C0009090', 'cui_str': 'Cluttering'}, {'cui': 'C0456603', 'cui_str': 'Ratio'}, {'cui': 'C0040223', 'cui_str': 'Time'}, {'cui': 'C0034656', 'cui_str': 'Randomization'}, {'cui': 'C0039010', 'cui_str': 'Swine Vesicular Disease'}, {'cui': 'C0002055', 'cui_str': 'Alkali'}, {'cui': 'C0180860', 'cui_str': 'Filter'}]",,0.0321407,"The processing time of the rSVD-based clutter filter was less than 30 ms and BCRs were higher than 20 dB as the block size, ensemble size and the rank of tissue clutter subspace were set as 30 × 30, 45 and 26 respectively.","[{'ForeName': 'U-Wai', 'Initials': 'UW', 'LastName': 'Lok', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Pengfei', 'Initials': 'P', 'LastName': 'Song', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Joshua D', 'Initials': 'JD', 'LastName': 'Trzasko', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Ron', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Daigle', 'Affiliation': 'Verasonics Inc., Kirkland, WA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Eric A', 'Initials': 'EA', 'LastName': 'Borisch', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Chengwu', 'Initials': 'C', 'LastName': 'Huang', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Ping', 'Initials': 'P', 'LastName': 'Gong', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Shanshan', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Tang', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Wenwu', 'Initials': 'W', 'LastName': 'Ling', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Ultrasound, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Shigao', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Chen', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN, USA.

This objective of this study was to determine if reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex versus neostigmine results in a decreased number of hypoxic episodes in the early postoperative period in patients undergoing thoracic surgery with single lung ventilation.
DESIGN


Single-center, randomized, double-blind, two-arm clinical trial.
SETTING


Operating room and postanesthesia care unit.
PATIENTS


92 subjects aged ≥18, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status II-IV, and undergoing a thoracic operation necessitating single lung ventilation.
INTERVENTIONS


Subjects received either 2 mg/kg sugammadex or 50 μg/kg neostigmine with 8 μg/kg glycopyrrolate for reversal of moderate neuromuscular blockade.
MEASUREMENTS


For the first 90 min postoperatively, all episodes of hypoxia were recorded. Neuromuscular monitoring was performed with acceleromyography (TOF-Watch® SX) and the train of four (TOF) was recorded at 2, 5, 10, and 15 min after administration of the neuromuscular reversal agent.
MAIN RESULTS


Subjects who received neostigmine had a median of 1 episode (interquartile range IQR: 0-2.2) of hypoxia versus subjects who received sugammadex who had a median of 0 episodes (IQR: 0-1) (p = 0.009). The mean time to recovery of TOF ≥ 0.9 was significantly faster with sugammadex at 10 min (95% confidence interval CI: 5-15) compared with neostigmine at 40 min (95% CI: 15-53) (p < 0.001).

437,32353962,Circulating Ionized Magnesium as a Measure of Supplement Bioavailability: Results from a Pilot Study for Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Oral supplementation may improve the dietary intake of magnesium, which has been identified as a shortfall nutrient. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate appropriate methods for assessing responses to the ingestion of oral magnesium supplements, including ionized magnesium in whole blood (iMg 2+ ) concentration, serum total magnesium concentration, and total urinary magnesium content. In a single-blinded crossover study, 17 healthy adults were randomly assigned to consume 300 mg of magnesium from MgCl 2  (ReMag ® , a picosized magnesium formulation) or placebo, while having a low-magnesium breakfast. Blood and urine samples were obtained for the measurement of iMg 2+ , serum total magnesium, and total urine magnesium, during 24 h following the magnesium supplement or placebo dosing. Bioavailability was assessed using area-under-the-curve (AUC) as well as maximum (C max ) and time-to-maximum (T max ) concentration. Depending on normality, data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation or median (range), and differences between responses to MgCl 2  or placebo were measured using the paired  t -test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Following MgCl 2  administration versus placebo administration, we observed significantly greater increases in iMg 2+  concentrations (AUC = 1.51 ± 0.96 vs. 0.84 ± 0.82 mg/dL·24h; C max  = 1.38 ± 0.13 vs. 1.32 ± 0.07 mg/dL, respectively; both  p  < 0.05) but not in serum total magnesium (AUC = 27.00 [0, 172.93] vs. 14.55 [0, 91.18] mg/dL·24h; C max  = 2.38 [1.97, 4.01] vs. 2.24 [1.98, 4.31] mg/dL) or in urinary magnesium (AUC = 201.74 ± 161.63 vs. 139.30 ± 92.84 mg·24h; C max  = 26.12 [12.91, 88.63] vs. 24.38 [13.51, 81.51] mg/dL;  p  > 0.05).

Fifteen healthy subjects (22 ± 3 years, 9 women) took part in the study. Subjects rinsed their mouth with either GS solution or distilled water before eating the sweet-tasting food. Subjects felt decreased sweet taste intensity and reduced taste liking associated with GS rinsing after consuming each food, compared with rinsing with distilled water ( p  < 0.05). Gastric emptying, BG, PI and appetite indices during and after the prandial phase did not significantly change with GS rinsing compared to rinsing with distilled water ( p  > 0.05). Higher desire for sweet taste as well as lower satisfaction ( p  < 0.05) in the postprandial phase were observed with GS rinsing. These results suggest that the suppression of OSS does not affect gastric emptying, glycemic response and appetite during and after consumption of sweet-tasting food.",2020,Higher desire for sweet taste as well as lower satisfaction ( p  < 0.05) in the postprandial phase were observed with GS rinsing.,"['Oral Sweet Sensations during Consumption of Sweet Food in Humans', 'Fifteen healthy subjects (22 ± 3 years, 9 women) took part in the study']","['oral sweet sensation (OSS', 'GS solution or distilled water before eating the sweet-tasting food', 'GS rinsing']","['Gastric Emptying Rate, Glycemic Response, Appetite, Food Satisfaction and Desire for Basic Tastes', 'gastric emptying, blood glucose (BG), plasma insulin (PI), appetite indices (hunger, fullness and prospective consumption), satisfaction and desire for tastes', 'Gastric emptying, BG, PI and appetite indices', 'gastric emptying, glycemic response and appetite', 'sweet taste intensity and reduced taste liking']","[{'cui': 'C0226896', 'cui_str': 'Oral cavity structure'}, {'cui': 'C0085077', 'cui_str': 'Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis'}, {'cui': 'C0036658', 'cui_str': 'Sensory perception'}, {'cui': 'C0009830', 'cui_str': 'Consumption'}, {'cui': 'C0453865', 'cui_str': 'Sweet food'}, {'cui': 'C0086418', 'cui_str': 'Homo sapiens'}, {'cui': 'C1708335', 'cui_str': 'Healthy Participants'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0043210', 'cui_str': 'Woman'}, {'cui': 'C1515187', 'cui_str': 'Take'}, {'cui': 'C0008972', 'cui_str': 'Clinical Study'}]","[{'cui': 'C0226896', 'cui_str': 'Oral cavity structure'}, {'cui': 'C0085077', 'cui_str': 'Acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis'}, {'cui': 'C0036658', 'cui_str': 'Sensory perception'}, {'cui': 'C0037633', 'cui_str': 'Solution'}, {'cui': 'C0020311', 'cui_str': 'Hydrotherapy'}, {'cui': 'C0004135', 'cui_str': 'Ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome'}, {'cui': 'C0016452', 'cui_str': 'Foods'}, {'cui': 'C1701810', 'cui_str': 'Rinse'}]","[{'cui': 'C0038351', 'cui_str': 'Stomach'}, {'cui': 'C0003618', 'cui_str': 'Food appetite'}, {'cui': 'C0016452', 'cui_str': 'Foods'}, {'cui': 'C0242428', 'cui_str': 'Satisfaction'}, {'cui': 'C0178499', 'cui_str': 'Base'}, {'cui': 'C0039336', 'cui_str': 'Finding of sense of taste'}, {'cui': 'C0017127', 'cui_str': 'Gastric emptying'}, {'cui': 'C0005802', 'cui_str': 'Glucose, Blood'}, {'cui': 'C0857690', 'cui_str': 'Plasma insulin'}, {'cui': 'C0600653', 'cui_str': 'Indexes'}, {'cui': 'C0020175', 'cui_str': 'Hungry'}, {'cui': 'C0439650', 'cui_str': 'Fullness'}, {'cui': 'C0023981', 'cui_str': 'Longitudinal Studies'}, {'cui': 'C0009830', 'cui_str': 'Consumption'}, {'cui': 'C0858600', 'cui_str': 'Taste sweet'}, {'cui': 'C0522510', 'cui_str': 'With intensity'}, {'cui': 'C0392756', 'cui_str': 'Reduced'}]",15.0,0.0208928,Higher desire for sweet taste as well as lower satisfaction ( p  < 0.05) in the postprandial phase were observed with GS rinsing.,"[{'ForeName': 'Naomi', 'Initials': 'N', 'LastName': 'Kashima', 'Affiliation': 'Faculty of Health Sciences, Hiroshima Shudo University, 1-1-1 Ozuka-higashi, Asaminami-ku, Hiroshima 731-3195, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kanako', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Kimura', 'Affiliation': 'School of Health Sciences, Prefectural University of Hiroshima, 1-1-71 Ujina-higashi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8558, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Natsumi', 'Initials': 'N', 'LastName': 'Nishitani', 'Affiliation': 'School of Health Sciences, Prefectural University of Hiroshima, 1-1-71 Ujina-higashi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8558, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Masako', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Yamaoka Endo', 'Affiliation': 'School of Health Sciences, Prefectural University of Hiroshima, 1-1-71 Ujina-higashi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8558, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Yoshiyuki', 'Initials': 'Y', 'LastName': 'Fukuba', 'Affiliation': 'School of Health Sciences, Prefectural University of Hiroshima, 1-1-71 Ujina-higashi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8558, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Hideaki', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Kashima', 'Affiliation': 'School of Health Sciences, Prefectural University of Hiroshima, 1-1-71 Ujina-higashi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8558, Japan.'}]",Nutrients,['10.3390/nu12051249']

442,32354152,Prebiotic Effects of Partially Hydrolyzed Guar Gum on the Composition and Function of the Human Microbiota-Results from the PAGODA Trial.,"(1) Background: Alterations in the structural composition of the human gut microbiota have been identified in various disease entities along with exciting mechanistic clues by reductionist gnotobiotic modeling. Improving health by beneficially modulating an altered microbiota is a promising treatment approach. Prebiotics, substrates selectively used by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit, are broadly used for dietary and clinical interventions. Herein, we sought to investigate the microbiota-modelling effects of the soluble fiber, partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG). (2) Methods: We performed a 9 week clinical trial in 20 healthy volunteers that included three weeks of a lead-in period, followed by three weeks of an intervention phase, wherein study subjects received 5 g PHGG up to three times per day, and concluding with a three-week washout period. A stool diary was kept on a daily basis, and clinical data along with serum/plasma and stool samples were collected on a weekly basis. PHGG-induced alterations of the gut microbiota were studied by 16S metagenomics of the V1-V3 and V3-V4 regions. To gain functional insight, we further studied stool metabolites using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. (3) Results: In healthy subjects, PHGG had significant effects on stool frequency and consistency. These effects were paralleled by changes in α- (species evenness) and β-diversity (Bray-Curtis distances), along with increasing abundances of metabolites including butyrate, acetate and various amino acids. On a taxonomic level, PHGG intake was associated with a bloom in  Ruminococcus ,  Fusicatenibacter ,  Faecalibacterium  and  Bacteroides  and a reduction in  Roseburia ,  Lachnospiracea  and  Blautia . The majority of effects disappeared after stopping the prebiotic and most effects tended to be more pronounced in male participants.

Seventeen patients with stroke with foot drop (8 men and 9 women) were randomized to three conditions (bare foot, UD-Flex AFO, or AOW made with a flexible material). Static balance was assessed using the Zebris (Zebris GmbH, Isny, Germany) and BioRescue (RM Ingenierie, Rodez, France) pressure platform by a single examiner, who did not design the AOW. The order of testing with the equipment was random. The center of pressure path length (mm) measured using Zebris showed significant differences among the three conditions (bare foot, 484.47 ± 208.42; UD-Flex AFO, 414.59 ± 144.43; AOW, 318.29 ± 157.60) ( p  < 0.05). The bare-foot condition was not significantly different from the UD-Flex AFO condition ( p  > 0.05), but was significantly different from the AOW condition ( p  < 0.05). The surface area ellipse (mm 2 ) measured using BioRescue showed significant differences among the three conditions (bare foot, 241.35 ± 153.76; UD-Flex AFO, 277.41 ± 381.83; AOW, 68.06 ± 48.98) ( p  < 0.05). The bare-foot condition was not significantly different from the UD-Flex AFO condition ( p  > 0.05), but the AOW condition was significantly different from the bare-foot ( p  < 0.05) and from the UD-Flex AFO conditions ( p  < 0.05).

444,32354228,Clinical Usefulness of PRECISE-DAPT Score for Predicting Bleeding Events in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: An Analysis From the SMART-DATE Randomized Trial.,"BACKGROUND


Although the current guidelines endorse the PRECISE-DAPT score (Predicting Bleeding Complications in Patients Undergoing Stent Implantation and Subsequent Dual Antiplatelet Therapy) to inform clinical decisions regarding duration of DAPT in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, use of the PRECISE-DAPT score to guide duration of DAPT has not been properly validated by randomized trials focused on the population with acute coronary syndrome. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of the PRECISE-DAPT score for predicting future bleeding and ischemic events and to compare clinical outcomes of short-term and long-term DAPT duration according to the PRECISE-DAPT score in patients with acute coronary syndrome.
METHODS


This was a substudy of the SMART-DATE trial (6- Versus 12-Month or Longer Dual Antiplatelet Therapy After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome), in which patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention were randomly assigned to either 6- (n=1357) or 12-month or longer DAPT (n=1355). Major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 3-5) and ischemic (myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, or ischemic stroke) events at 18 months after the index procedure were compared between the 6- and 12-month or longer DAPT groups, according to PRECISE-DAPT score.
RESULTS


The PRECISE-DAPT score was moderately effective at predicting bleeding events (area under the curve, 0.754 [95% CI, 0.655-0.854];  P <0.001). In patients with nonhigh PRECISE-DAPT score (<25, n=1967 [72.5%]), 6-month DAPT was associated with higher ischemic risk (2.7% versus 1.3%; HR, 2.01 [95% CI, 1.03-3.91];  P =0.040; absolute risk difference, +1.3%;  P =0.035) with similar bleeding risk (0.4% versus 0.3%; HR, 2.00 [95% CI, 0.37-10.94];  P =0.422; absolute risk difference, +0.2%;  P =0.498), compared with 12-month or longer DAPT. Among patients with high PRECISE-DAPT score (≥25, n=745 [27.5%]), 6-month DAPT presented a similar ischemic risk (4.8% versus 3.4%; HR, 1.43 [95% CI, 0.68-2.98],  P =0.348; absolute risk difference, +1.5%;  P =0.327) but significantly reduced major bleeding risk (0.6% versus 2.3%; HR, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.05-1.17];  P =0.079; absolute risk difference, -1.7%;  P =0.045).
CONCLUSIONS


Consistent with current guidelines, determination of the duration of DAPT according to PRECISE-DAPT score could improve the clinical outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome after percutaneous coronary intervention with current-generation drug-eluting stents.

445,32354234,The novel cognitive flexibility in aphasia therapy (CFAT): A combined treatment of aphasia and executive functions to improve communicative success.,"Purpose : Over and above language deficits, persons with aphasia can present with impairments in executive functions, including deficits in cognitive flexibility. Cognitive flexibility constitutes the ability to update behaviour quickly and flexibly in a changing environment. Its deficits can restrict communicative ability, e. g. the ability to change a topic. To date, these deficits have been neglected in aphasia therapy, even though their consideration regarding language treatment may be beneficial for the persons affected. The present study aimed to evaluate whether aphasia therapy including cognitive flexibility leads to more improvement than conventional aphasia therapy. Method : A pilot group study with ten patients was conducted. The patients received both the novel Cognitive Flexibility in Aphasia Therapy (CFAT) and conventional aphasia therapy in a cross-over design. Each therapy method was delivered for 20 sessions within two weeks. An assessment battery was applied five times, including language skills, communicative ability and verbal/nonverbal cognitive flexibility. Result:  Patients profited from CFAT regarding language skills, communicative ability and verbal cognitive flexibility. Furthermore, compared to conventional therapy, CFAT was more effective for verbal cognitive flexibility.

447,32348882,Acceptability of an Orodispersible Film Compared to Syrup in Neonates and Infants: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"OBJECTIVES


Reliable pediatric pharmacotherapy in all age groups requires the availability of age-appropriate drug administration. Orodispersible films (ODF) are a promising pediatric oral dosage form. ODFs would meet relevant targets: one dosage form matching the full range of pediatric patients, a minimum of non-toxic excipients, a stable drug formulation easily to be produced. However, there is a lack of reliable data on ODFś acceptability, swallowability and palatability, especially in young children. The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority in acceptability of a drug-free ODF in comparison to glucose syrup in children aged below one year. Secondary objectives were swallowability and palatability of the two formulations.
STUDY DESIGN


The study was performed in an open, randomized, two-way cross-over design with three age groups: 2 - 28 days, 29 days - 5 months, 6 - 12 months. 150 children (N=50 per age group) were randomized to the order of receiving the ODF (2 x 3 cm) and age-adapted amounts of glucose syrup (0.5 to 3 mL). Deglutition and swallowing were assessed according to predefined evaluation criteria. The application of the formulations was documented by video to evaluate the palatability.
RESULTS


The primary objective was confirmed: Non-inferiority of the acceptability of an ODF compared to syrup was demonstrated, even superiority of the ODF was shown (p<0.0001). The secondary endpoints demonstrated positive results including the superior swallowability of the ODF in comparison to syrup (p<0.0001). The palatability assessments were in favor of the ODF.

448,32348960,Sacubitril/valsartan increases postprandial gastrin and cholecystokinin in plasma.,"AIMS


Neprilysin degrades natriuretic peptides in circulation and is also suggested to degrade the gut hormones gastrin and cholecystokinin. Neprilysin inhibition has become a therapeutic strategy and thus a regimen in need of further testing in terms of other hormonal axes besides natriuretic peptides. The aim of this study was to examine whether acute inhibition of neprilysin affects meal-induced responses in gastrin and cholecystokinin concentrations in healthy individuals.
METHODS AND RESULTS


Nine healthy young men were included in an open-labelled, randomized cross-over clinical trial. The participants received a standardized meal (25 g fat, 26 g protein, 42 g carbohydrate) on two separate days with or without a one-time dosage of sacubitril ((194 mg)/valsartan (206 mg)). Blood pressure, heart rate and blood samples were measured and collected during the experiment. Statistical differences between groups were assessed using area under the curve together with an ANOVA with a Bonferroni post hoc test. Sacubitril/valsartan increased the postprandial plasma concentrations of both gastrin and cholecystokinin (80% (AUC0-270 min, P = 0.0038) and 60% (AUC0-270 min, P = 0.003), respectively) compared with the control meal. No significant hemodynamic effects were noted (blood pressure, AUC0-270 min, P = 0.86, heart rate, AUC0-270 min, P = 0.96).
CONCLUSION


Our study demonstrates that sacubitril/valsartan increases the postprandial plasma concentrations of gastrin and cholecystokinin in healthy individuals. The results thus suggest that neprilysin-mediated degradation of gastrin and cholecystokinin is physiologically relevant and may have a role in heart failure patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan.",2020,"No significant hemodynamic effects were noted (blood pressure, AUC0-270 min, P = 0.86, heart rate, AUC0-270 min, P = 0.96).

449,32348985,Protocol and Baseline Data of a Multicentre Prospective Double-Blinded Randomized Study of Intravenous Iron on Functional Status in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease.,"BACKGROUND


Iron deficiency (ID) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to an inadequate dietary intake of iron, poor absorption from the gut and increased iron losses. In addition to preventing anaemia, iron is important for normal heart function, being involved in processes that generate a necessary continuous energy supply. Treatment with intravenous (IV) iron has been suggested to lead to improvement in heart function and well-being in people with ID and CKD. In the Iron and the Heart Study, we hypothesized that IV iron treatment will primarily improve exercise capacity and may secondarily impact the feeling of well-being in comparison to placebo over 3 months in non-anaemic CKD patients who have ID.
METHODS


This was a prospective double-blinded explorative randomized, multi-centre study designed to compare the effects of IV iron supplementation and placebo in iron-deficient but not anaemic patients with established CKD stages 3b-5 on functional status, and in addition cardiac structure and function. The study included 54 adults with serum ferritin (SF) <100 µg/L and/or transferrin saturation <20%, randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1,000 mg IV ferric derisomaltose or placebo. Following randomization, participants underwent baseline assessments and then received IV iron or placebo infusion. Each participant was followed up at months 1 and 3. At each visit, patients underwent clinical review, measurements of hematinics and haemoglobin (Hb), and assessments of physical function and well-being. The primary outcome was exercise capacity using the 6-minute walk test. Secondary objectives included effects on hematinic profiles and Hb concentration, changes in myocardial parameters assessed with speckle tracking echocardiography and change in patients' quality of life.
RESULTS


Between October 2016 and April 2018, 55 from 326 individuals from 3 UK centres attended screening and were randomized. The mean (SD) age was 59.6 (11.7) years, 26 (48%) patients were male, the majority were Caucasians (42; 78%), and 32 (59%) were non-smokers. The mean (SD) body mass index was 30.3 (6.5); SF was 66.3 (44.1) µg/L, TS was 20.1 (7.4) % and Hb was 128.7 (10.1) g/L at randomization for the whole group. Mean (SD) serum creatinine was 186.7 (58.6) µmol/L, estimated glomerular filtration rate was 31.1 (9.6) mL/min/1.73 m2 and urinary albumin and protein/creatinine ratios 60.9 (133.3) and 83.8 (128.4) mg/mmol respectively. The mean (SD) C-reactive protein was 5.0 (4.4) mg/L and the mean (SD) 6-minute walk distance at baseline was 401.2 (120.2) m.
CONCLUSION


The Iron and the Heart Trial will provide important information on the short-term effects of IV iron treatment in CKD patients with ID without anaemia on measures of exercise capacity, quality of life and mechanistic data on myocardial structure and function.

450,32349005,A Randomized Controlled Comparison of Epidural Analgesia Onset Time and Adverse Reactions During Labor with Different dose Combinations of Bupivacaine and Sufentanil.,"OBJECTIVES


The purpose was to compare the effects of three different dose combinations of bupivacaine and sufentanil on the onset of analgesia and the occurrence of side effects.
METHODS


One hundred sixty-nine pregnant women were randomly assigned to 3 groups: the B1S5 group received 0.1% bupivacaine + 5▒μg sufentanil in 15▒mL; the B125S5 group received 0.125% bupivacaine + 5▒μg sufentanil in 15▒mL; and the B1S10 group received 0.1% bupivacaine + 10▒μg sufentanil in 15▒mL. The primary outcome was the analgesic onset time, and the secondary outcomes were mode of delivery, patient satisfaction, maternal and neonatal side effects (pruritus, hypotension, sedation, motor block, decreased fetal heart rate, fever and breast feeding).
RESULTS


The median (IQR [range]) time to achieve effective analgesia was significantly faster in the B125S5 group than in the B1S5 group (10 (11-14 [4-30]) min vs. 15 (17-20 [5-30]) min, P<0.001). There was no significant difference in the analgesia onset time between the B1S10 and B125S5 groups (10 (11-14 [4-30]) min vs. 12 (13-15 [3-30]) min, P=0.202). Pruritus, hypotension, motor block, maternal satisfaction, delivery mode, decreased fetal heart rate, total bupivacaine dose and breastfeeding scores were not significantly different among the three groups except the sufentanil dosage, incidence of mild drowsiness and fever (the B1S10 group had significantly higher fever than the other groups).

451,32349223,Effects of Small-Sided Recreational Volleyball on Health Markers and Physical Fitness in Middle-Aged Men.,"The present study aimed to investigate whether recreational volleyball organized as small-sided games could improve fitness and health profiles of middle-aged men after 10 weeks of training. Twenty-four healthy men aged 35-55 were randomized in a small-sided recreational volleyball group (RV = 12; age: 44.7 ± 6.34 years; body mass index: 25.85 ± 1.74) and control group (CON = 12; age: 42.9 ± 8.72 years; body mass index: 25.62 ± 1.48). The RV group carried out a volleyball training program, whereas the CON group continued their daily life activities during this period. The participants in the RV group performed 2/3 training sessions of 90 min per week. Results from a repeated measure ANOVA indicated a significant group × time interaction for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (F = 6.776,  p  = 0.016, partial ƞ 2  = 0.235) and for resting heart rate (F = 11.647,  p  = 0.002, partial ƞ 2  = 0.346) in favor of the RV group. No significant changes were observed for body weight, body mass index, and diastolic blood pressure. Results for physical fitness indicated a significant interaction for Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test-level 2 (F = 11.648,  p  = 0.003, partial ƞ 2  = 0.380), with no significant changes in both groups for handgrip strength.

452,32349260,Impact of Combined Theory-Based Intervention on Psychological Effects and Physical Activity among Chinese Adolescents.,"PURPOSE


The current study was intended to assess the effect of a facilitated behavioral intervention based on the extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) on psychological constructs and physical activity among adolescents over a period of eight weeks.
METHODS


Students ( n  = 51, 12 ± 0.3 years of age) in the seventh grade at a junior middle school in China were randomly assigned to two groups: the intervention group ( n  = 24) and the control group ( n  = 27). Both groups were pre- and post-tested with the related psychological constructs of the extended TPB, along with behavioral measures of the Physical Activity Scale and ActiGraph accelerometer (model wGT3X-BT). The intervention group took part in 45 min classes once per week for 8 weeks, including five indoor theoretical courses and three outdoor basketball matches. The control group was not required to make any change to their normal school day. Also, 2 × 2 repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to compare the differences between the two groups, and then  t -test was employed to compare the independent and paired differences.
RESULTS


Significant increases in pre-post subjective norms (SN) ( p  = 0.041, Cohen's d = 0.62), perceived behavior control (PBC) ( p  = 0.023, Cohen's d = 0.72), exercise intention (EI) ( p  = 0.043, Cohen's d = 0.61), and self-efficacy (SE) ( p  = 0.035, Cohen's d = 1.36) were observed in the intervention group. In addition, participants in the intervention group increased their exercise frequency ( p  < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.25) and intensity ( p  = 0.028, Cohen's d = 0.68), especially their time spent on light intensity physical activity (light-PA%;  p  = 0.031, Cohen's d = 0.68), and their percentage of sedentary time (SB%) was also reduced (from 68% ± 10% to 58% ± 7%,  p  < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.17). Furthermore, the intervention group showed significantly better performance in PBC ( p  = 0.032, Cohen's d = 0.62), EI ( p  < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.32), SE ( p  < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.15), SB% ( p  < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.22), light-PA% ( p  < 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.12), and total physical activity (TPA) ( p  = 0.015, Cohen's d = 0.72) compared to the control group at the post-test. No significant pre post differences were observed for any psychological or behavioral variables in the control group, except for exercise frequency, but the values were still lower than those in the intervention group after the 8-week intervention (3.70 ± 0.72 versus 3.92 ± 0.83).

453,32349288,Investigating the Effects of Chiropractic Spinal Manipulation on EEG in Stroke Patients.,":   Objective:  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of chiropractic spinal manipulation on the early somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from chronic stroke patients.  Methods:  Seventeen male patients (53 ± 12 years old) participated in this randomized cross-over study. The patients received chiropractic spinal manipulation and control intervention, in random order, separated by at least 24 hours. EEG was recorded before and after each intervention during rest and stimulation of the non-paretic median nerve. For resting-state EEG, the delta-alpha ratio, brain-symmetry index, and power-spectra were calculated. For SEPs, the amplitudes and latencies of N20 and N30 peaks were assessed. Source localization was performed on the power-spectra of resting-state EEG and the N30 SEP peak.  Results:  Following spinal manipulation, the N30 amplitude increased by 39%, which was a significant increase compared to the control intervention ( p  < 0.01). The latency and changes to the strength of the cortical sources underlying the N30 peak were not significant. The N20 peak, the resting-state power-spectra, delta-alpha ratio, brain-symmetry index, and resting-state source localization showed no significant changes after either intervention.  Conclusion:  A single session of chiropractic spinal manipulation increased the amplitude of the N30 SEP peak in a group of chronic stroke patients, which may reflect changes to early sensorimotor function. More research is required to investigate the long-term effects of chiropractic spinal manipulation, to better understand what impact it may have on the neurological function of stroke survivors.",2020,", the N30 amplitude increased by 39%, which was a significant increase compared to the control intervention ( p  < 0.01).","['Seventeen male patients (53 ± 12 years old', 'Stroke Patients', 'chronic stroke patients']","['spinal manipulation', 'Chiropractic Spinal Manipulation', 'chiropractic spinal manipulation', 'chiropractic spinal manipulation and control intervention']","['early somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and resting-state electroencephalography (EEG', 'amplitudes and latencies of N20 and N30 peaks', 'resting-state power-spectra, delta-alpha ratio, brain-symmetry index, and resting-state source localization', 'EEG', 'amplitude of the N30 SEP peak', 'N30 amplitude', 'delta-alpha ratio, brain-symmetry index, and power-spectra']","[{'cui': 'C0450331', 'cui_str': '17'}, {'cui': 'C0086582', 'cui_str': 'Male'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0580836', 'cui_str': 'Old'}, {'cui': 'C0038454', 'cui_str': 'Cerebrovascular accident'}, {'cui': 'C3536593', 'cui_str': 'Chronic cerebrovascular accident'}]","[{'cui': 'C0086586', 'cui_str': 'Manipulation of spine'}, {'cui': 'C0008138', 'cui_str': 'Chiropractic'}, {'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}, {'cui': 'C0184661', 'cui_str': 'Procedure'}]","[{'cui': 'C1279919', 'cui_str': 'Early'}, {'cui': 'C0015216', 'cui_str': 'Somatosensory evoked potential'}, {'cui': 'C0679218', 'cui_str': 'Resting state'}, {'cui': 'C0013819', 'cui_str': 'Electroencephalogram'}, {'cui': 'C0242465', 'cui_str': 'Response Latency'}, {'cui': 'C0444505', 'cui_str': 'Peak'}, {'cui': 'C0439097', 'cui_str': 'Delta'}, {'cui': 'C0439095', 'cui_str': 'Alpha'}, {'cui': 'C0456603', 'cui_str': 'Ratio'}, {'cui': 'C0006104', 'cui_str': 'Brain structure'}, {'cui': 'C0332516', 'cui_str': 'Symmetrical'}, {'cui': 'C0600653', 'cui_str': 'Indexes'}, {'cui': 'C0449416', 'cui_str': 'Source'}, {'cui': 'C0037710', 'cui_str': 'Auditory localization'}]",17.0,0.0229653,", the N30 amplitude increased by 39%, which was a significant increase compared to the control intervention ( p  < 0.01).","[{'ForeName': 'Muhammad Samran', 'Initials': 'MS', 'LastName': 'Navid', 'Affiliation': 'Mech-Sense, Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Aalborg University Hospital, 9000 Aalborg, Denmark.'}, {'ForeName': 'Imran Khan', 'Initials': 'IK', 'LastName': 'Niazi', 'Affiliation': 'Centre for Chiropractic Research, New Zealand College of Chiropractic, Auckland 1060, New Zealand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Dina', 'Initials': 'D', 'LastName': 'Lelic', 'Affiliation': 'Mech-Sense, Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Aalborg University Hospital, 9000 Aalborg, Denmark.'}, {'ForeName': 'Rasmus Bach', 'Initials': 'RB', 'LastName': 'Nedergaard', 'Affiliation': 'Mech-Sense, Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Aalborg University Hospital, 9000 Aalborg, Denmark.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kelly', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Holt', 'Affiliation': 'Centre for Chiropractic Research, New Zealand College of Chiropractic, Auckland 1060, New Zealand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Imran', 'Initials': 'I', 'LastName': 'Amjad', 'Affiliation': 'Centre for Chiropractic Research, New Zealand College of Chiropractic, Auckland 1060, New Zealand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Asbjørn Mohr', 'Initials': 'AM', 'LastName': 'Drewes', 'Affiliation': 'Mech-Sense, Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Aalborg University Hospital, 9000 Aalborg, Denmark.'}, {'ForeName': 'Heidi', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Haavik', 'Affiliation': 'Centre for Chiropractic Research, New Zealand College of Chiropractic, Auckland 1060, New Zealand.'}]",Brain sciences,['10.3390/brainsci10050253']
454,32349353,Potato Protein Isolate Stimulates Muscle Protein Synthesis at Rest and with Resistance Exercise in Young Women.,"Skeletal muscle myofibrillar protein synthesis (MPS) increases in response to protein feeding and to resistance exercise (RE), where each stimuli acts synergistically when combined. The efficacy of plant proteins such as potato protein (PP) isolate to stimulate MPS is unknown. We aimed to determine the effects of PP ingestion on daily MPS with and without RE in healthy women. In a single blind, parallel-group design, 24 young women (21 ± 3 years,  n  = 12/group) consumed a weight-maintaining baseline diet containing 0.8 g/kg/d of protein before being randomized to consume either 25 g of PP twice daily (1.6 g/kg/d total protein) or a control diet (CON) (0.8 g/kg/d total protein) for 2 wks. Unilateral RE (~30% of maximal strength to failure) was performed thrice weekly with the opposite limb serving as a non-exercised control (Rest). MPS was measured by deuterated water ingestion at baseline, following supplementation (Rest), and following supplementation + RE (Exercise). Ingestion of PP stimulated MPS by 0.14 ± 0.09 %/d at Rest, and by 0.32 ± 0.14 %/d in the Exercise limb. MPS was significantly elevated by 0.20 ± 0.11 %/d in the Exercise limb in CON ( P  = 0.008).

455,32349742,The effect of aged garlic extract on the atherosclerotic process - a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND


One of the most serious secondary manifestations of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is coronary atherosclerosis. This study aimed to evaluate whether aged garlic extract (AGE) can influence coronary artery calcification (CAC) and to predict the individual effect of AGE using a standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM).
METHOD


This was a single-center parallel randomized controlled study in a university hospital in Europe. Patients were randomized, in a double-blind manner, through a computer-generated randomization chart. Patients with a Framingham risk score ≥ 10 after CT scan (n = 104) were randomized to an intake of placebo or AGE (2400 mg daily) for 1 year. Main outcome measures were changes in CAC score and secondary outcome measures changes in blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, blood lipids and inflammatory biomarkers.
RESULT


104 patients were randomized and 46 in the active group and 47 in the placebo group were analyzed. There was a significant (p < 0.05) change in CAC progression (OR: 2.95 [1.05-8.27]), blood glucose (OR: 3.1 [1.09-8.85]) and IL-6 (OR 2.56 [1.00-6.53]) in favor of the active group. There was also a significant (p = 0.027) decrease in systolic blood pressure in the AGE group, from a mean of 148 (SD: 19) mmHg at 0 months, to 140 (SD: 15) mmHg after 12 months. The AGE Algorithm, at a selected probability cut-off value of 0.5, the accuracy score for CAC progression was 80%, precision score of 79% and recall score 83%. The score for blood pressure was 74% (accuracy, precision and recall). There were no side-effects in either group.
CONCLUSIONS


AGE inhibits CAC progression, lowers IL-6, glucose levels and blood pressure in patients at increased risk of cardiovascular events in a European cohort. An algorithm was made and was used to predict with 80% precision which patient will have a significantly reduced CAC progression using AGE. The algorithm could also predict with a 74% precision which patient will have a significant blood pressure lowering effect pressure using AGE.

456,32349746,"Comparison of explicit values clarification method (VCM), implicit VCM and no VCM decision aids for men considering prostate cancer screening: protocol of a randomized trial.","BACKGROUND


Screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test for prostate cancer is considered a preference sensitive decision; meaning it does not only depend on what is best from a medical point of view, but also from a patient value standpoint. Decision aids are evidence-based tools which are shown to help people feel clearer about their values; therefore it has been advocated that decision aids should contain a specific values clarification method (VCM). VCMs may be either implicit or explicit, but the evidence concerning the best method is scarce. We aim to compare the perceived clarity of personal values in men considering PSA screening using decision aids with no VCM versus an implicit VCM versus an explicit VCM.
METHODS


Male factory employees from an industrial facility in the Northern region of Portugal aged 50 to 69 years old will be randomly assigned to one of three decision aid groups used to support prostate cancer screening decisions: (i) decision aid with information only (control), (ii) decision aid with information plus an implicit VCM, (iii) decision aid with information plus an explicit VCM. Men will be allowed release time from work to attend a session at their workplace. After a brief oral presentation, those willing to participate in the study will fill the baseline questionnaire, plus a 5 point-Likert scale question about intentions to undergo screening, and will then receive the intervention materials to complete. We estimated a total sample size of 276 participants; with 92 in each group. The primary outcome will be the perceived clarity of personal values assessed by the Portuguese validated translation of the three subscales of the Decisional Conflict Scale. Secondary outcomes will be intention to be screened (before and after the intervention), the total score from the Decisional Conflict Scale and the self-report of having or not undergone screening at 6 months.
DISCUSSION


This study will add to the body of evidence on the role of decision aids to support health preference-sensitive choices and provide further insight on the impact of different methods for eliciting people's values embedded within a decision aid.

457,32349752,The use of a task through virtual reality in cerebral palsy using two different interaction devices (concrete and abstract) - a cross-sectional randomized study.,"BACKGROUND


Cerebral Palsy (CP) is characterised by variable difficulties in muscular action, resulting in inability of the individual to perform functional movement. An option to provide functionality to the individual with CP is the use of computer innovation. The aim of this paper was to verify if there was any performance improvement in a task performed in a virtual environment and if there was transfer to the task performed in the real environment and vice versa in this population.
METHODS


A computer program was developed comprising a motor task, but with two possibilities of user interaction: a) concrete interface (with physical contact): in which the individual touches the computer screen to finish the task and b) abstract interface (no physical contact): in which the individual performs a hand movement in front of the Kinect device. Participants were split into two groups. The experimental group consisted of 28 individuals with CP within the ages of 6 and 15 years old. The control group included 28 typically developing individuals mirroring the age and sex of the experimental group.
RESULTS


Individuals from both groups were able to improve task performance and retain acquired information. The CP group presented worse performance than the control group in all phases of the study. Further findings showed that the CP group presented better performance in the abstract interface than in the concrete interface, whereas, in the control group, the opposite occurred: their best performance was in the concrete.
CONCLUSIONS


Motor tasks performed by individuals with CP through an interface with a more virtual environment feature (abstract interface: Kinect) provided better performance when compared to an interface with a more real characteristic (concrete interface: Touchscreen).

458,32349761,Stand Out in Class: restructuring the classroom environment to reduce sitting time - findings from a pilot cluster randomised controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND


Excessive sedentary behaviour (sitting) is a risk factor for poor health in children and adults. Incorporating sit-stand desks in the classroom environment has been highlighted as a potential strategy to reduce children's sitting time. The primary aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of conducting a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a sit-stand desk intervention within primary school classrooms.
METHODS


We conducted a two-armed pilot cluster RCT involving 8 primary schools in Bradford, United Kingdom. Schools were randomised on a 1:1 basis to the intervention or usual practice control arm. All children (aged 9-10 years) in participating classes were eligible to take part. Six sit-stand desks replaced three standard desks (sitting 6 children) in the intervention classrooms for 4.5-months. Teachers were encouraged to use a rotation system to ensure all pupils were exposed to the sit-stand desks for > 1 h/day on average. Trial feasibility outcomes (assessed using quantitative and qualitative measures) included school and participant recruitment and attrition, intervention and outcome measure completion rates, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the intervention for reducing sitting time. A weighted linear regression model compared changes in weekday sitting time (assessed using the activPAL accelerometer) between trial arms.
RESULTS


School and child recruitment rates were 33% (n = 8) and 75% (n = 176). At follow-up, retention rates were 100% for schools and 97% for children. Outcome measure completion rates ranged from 63 to 97%. A preliminary estimate of intervention effectiveness revealed a mean difference in change in sitting of - 30.6 min/day (95% CI: - 56.42 to - 4.84) in favour of the intervention group, after adjusting for baseline sitting and wear time. Qualitative measures revealed the intervention and evaluation procedures were acceptable to teachers and children, except for some problems with activPAL attachment.
CONCLUSION


This study provides evidence of the acceptability and feasibility of a sit-stand desk intervention and evaluation methods. Preliminary evidence suggests the intervention showed potential in reducing children's weekday sitting but some adaptations to the desk rotation system are needed to maximize exposure. Lessons learnt from this trial will inform the planning of a definitive trial.

459,32349927,Long-term Castration-related Outcomes in Patients With High-risk Localized Prostate Cancer Treated With Androgen Deprivation Therapy With or Without Docetaxel and Estramustine in the UNICANCER GETUG-12 Trial.,"INTRODUCTION


Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel and estramustine (DE) significantly improved relapse-free survival in patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for 3 years and a local treatment in the GETUG-12 phase III trial. We sought to explore whether the addition of DE impacts long-term treatment-related side effects.
PATIENTS AND METHODS


Patients randomized within the UNICANCER GETUG-12 trial at Gustave Roussy who were alive when ADT was discontinued were followed-up prospectively. Serum testosterone levels and clinical data regarding body weight, libido, erection, and cardio-vascular events were collected.
RESULTS


Seventy-eight patients were included: 36 patients had been treated with ADT plus a local treatment and 42 with ADT+DE plus a local treatment. With a median follow-up of 5.9 years after ADT discontinuation, serum testosterone levels returned to normal values (> 200 ng/mL) for 57 (78%) of 72 evaluable patients, and 29 (43%) of 68 evaluable patients reported erections allowing intercourse without medical assistance. No impact of DE on testosterone level recovery, libido, quality of erections, and changes in body weight after ADT discontinuation was detected. The incidence of cardiovascular events was low and similar in both treatment arms.
CONCLUSION


Treatment with DE was not associated with excess long-term castration-related toxicity in men with high-risk localized prostate cancer. The relapse-free survival improvement seen with DE in GETUG-12 is likely not related to differed testosterone recovery.",2020,"With a median follow-up of 5.9 years after ADT discontinuation, serum

460,32349977,Bioimpedance Guided Fluid Management in Peritoneal Dialysis: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES


Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) devices can help assess volume overload in patients receiving maintenance peritoneal dialysis. However, the effects of BIA on the short-term hard end points of peritoneal dialysis lack consistency. This study aimed to test whether BIA-guided fluid management could improve short-term outcomes in patients on peritoneal dialysis.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS


A single-center, open-labeled, randomized, controlled trial was conducted. Patients on prevalent peritoneal dialysis with volume overload were recruited from July 1, 2013 to March 30, 2014 and followed for 1 year in the initial protocol. All participants with volume overload were 1:1 randomized to the BIA-guided arm (BIA and traditional clinical methods) and control arm (only traditional clinical methods). The primary end point was all-cause mortality and secondary end points were cardiovascular disease mortality and technique survival.
RESULTS


A total of 240 patients (mean age, 49 years; men, 51%; diabetic, 21%, 120 per group) were enrolled. After 1-year follow-up, 11(5%) patients died (three in BIA versus eight in control) and 21 patients were permanently transferred to hemodialysis (eight in BIA versus 13 in control). The rate of extracellular water/total body water decline in the BIA group was significantly higher than that in the control group. The 1-year patient survival rates were 96% and 92% in BIA and control groups, respectively. No significant statistical differences were found between patients randomized to the BIA-guided or control arm in terms of patient survival, cardiovascular disease mortality, and technique survival ( P >0.05).

461,32350016,Clinical and cost-effectiveness of a diabetes education and behavioural weight management programme versus a diabetes education programme in adults with a recent diagnosis of type 2 diabetes: study protocol for the Glucose Lowering through Weight management (GLoW) randomised controlled trial.,"INTRODUCTION


People with type 2 diabetes (T2D) can improve glycaemic control or even achieve remission through weight loss and reduce their use of medication and risk of cardiovascular disease. The Glucose Lowering through Weight management (GLoW) trial will evaluate whether a tailored diabetes education and behavioural weight management programme (DEW) is more effective and cost-effective than a diabetes education (DE) programme in helping people with overweight or obesity and a recent diagnosis of T2D to lower their blood glucose, lose weight and improve other markers of cardiovascular risk.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS


This study is a pragmatic, randomised, single-blind, parallel group, two-arm, superiority trial. We will recruit 576 adults with body mass index>25 kg/m 2  and diagnosis of T2D in the past 3 years and randomise them to a tailored DEW or a DE programme. Participants will attend measurement appointments at a local general practitioner practice or research centre at baseline, 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome is 12-month change in glycated haemoglobin. The effect of the intervention on the primary outcome will be estimated and tested using a linear regression model (analysis of covariance) including randomisation group and adjusted for baseline value of the outcome and the randomisation stratifiers. Participants will be included in the group to which they were randomised, under the intention-to-treat principle. Secondary outcomes include 6-month and 12-month changes in body weight, body fat percentage, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and lipid profile; probability of achieving good glycaemic control; probability of achieving remission from diabetes; probability of losing 5% and 10% body weight and modelled cardiovascular risk (UKPDS). An intention-to-treat within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from NHS and societal perspectives using participant-level data. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with participants to understand why and how the programme achieved its results and how participants manage their weight after the programme ends.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION


Ethical approval was received from East of Scotland Research Ethics Service on 15 May 2018 (18/ES/0048). This protocol (V.3) was approved on 19 June 2019. Findings will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and communicated to other stakeholders as appropriate.

462,32350145,"Effects of Dynamic Stretching Combined With Static Stretching, Foam Rolling, or Vibration Rolling as a Warm-Up Exercise on Athletic Performance in Elite Table Tennis Players.","CONTEXT


Warm-up exercise is an essential preexercise routine for athletes to optimize performance. However, the benefits of combined warm-up protocols remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE


This comparative study investigated the acute effects of dynamic stretching (DS) followed by static stretching (SS), self-myofascial release using a foam rolling (FR) device, or vibration foam rolling (VFR) as a warm-up exercise to improve flexibility, power, agility, and specific skills in elite table tennis players.
DESIGN


A crossover study.
SETTING


University.
PARTICIPANTS


Twenty-three elite table tennis players.
INTERVENTIONS


Players completed 3 different interventions in a random order (DS + SS, DS + FR, and DS + VFR). The target muscle groups included the bilateral posterior calf, posterior thigh, anterior thigh, back, and shoulder.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES


Sit-and-reach test for flexibility, board jump test for lower-extremity power, medicine ball throw test for upper-extremity power, Edgren Side Step Test for agility, and ball speed of table tennis was assessed before and after intervention.
RESULTS


After intervention, significant increases in flexibility (15.2%, 20.4%, and 23.8%); lower-limb power (4.5%, 6.6%, and 6.3%); upper-limb power (9.6%, 8.5%, and 9.1%); and ball speed (7.4%, 7.6%, and 7.7%) were observed for DS + SS, DS + FR, and DS + VFR, respectively (all P < .001). In addition, only DS coupled with FR (5.1%) and DS in conjunction with VFR (2.7%) significantly improved agility (P < .001). However, no significant improvements in agility were observed after DS + SS. In addition, no one protocol was superior to the other in all outcomes.
CONCLUSION


The authors suggest that a combination of DS with FR or VFR as warm-up exercises significantly improved flexibility, power, ball speed, in addition to agility in elite table tennis players.

463,32354780,Study protocol for a prospective randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating a Better Outcome with Melatonin compared to Placebo Administered to normalize sleep-wake cycle and treat hypoactive ICU Delirium: the Basel BOMP-AID study.,"INTRODUCTION


Delirium is frequently observed in the intensive care unit (ICU) population, in particular. Until today, there is no evidence for any reliable pharmacological intervention to treat delirium. The Basel BOMP-AID ( B etter  O utcome with  M elatonin compared to  P lacebo  A dministered to normalize sleep-wake cycle and treat hypoactive  I CU  D elirium) randomised trial targets improvement of hypoactive delirium therapy in critically ill patients and will be conducted as a counterpart to the Basel ProDex Study (Study Protocol, BMJ Open, July 2017) on hyperactive and mixed delirium. The aim of the BOMP-AID trial is to assess the superiority of melatonin to placebo for the treatment of hypoactive delirium in the ICU. The study hypothesis is based on the assumption that melatonin administered at night restores a normal circadian rhythm, and that restoration of a normal circadian rhythm will cure delirium.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS


The Basel BOMP-AID study is an investigator-initiated, single-centre, randomised controlled clinical trial for the treatment of hypoactive delirium with the once daily oral administration of melatonin 4 mg versus placebo in 190 critically ill patients. The primary outcome measure is delirium duration in 8-hour shifts. Secondary outcome measures include delirium-free days and death at 28 days after study inclusion, number of ventilator days, length of ICU and hospital stay, and sleep quality. Patients will be followed after 3 and 12 months for activities of daily living and mortality assessment. Sample size was calculated to demonstrate superiority of melatonin compared with placebo regarding the duration of delirium. Results will be presented using an intention-to-treat approach.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION


This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Northwestern and Central Switzerland and will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use; Good Clinical Practice (GCP) or ISO EN 14155 (as far as applicable), as well as all national legal and regulatory requirements. Study results will be presented in international conferences and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

464,32354851,The Additive Effects of Cell Phone Use and Dental Hygiene Practice on Finger Muscle Strength: A Pilot Study.,"Purpose:  The purpose of this study was to determine strength of muscles involved with instrumentation (scaling) by dental hygienists and the additive effects of cellular (mobile) phone usage, as indicated by measurements of muscular force generation. Methods:  A convenience sample of licensed dental hygienists currently in clinical practice (n=16) and an equal number of individuals not currently using devices/tools repetitively for work (n=16), agreed to participate in this pilot study. All participants completed a modified cell phone usage questionnaire to determine their use pattern and frequency. Upon completion of the questionnaire, participants' force production in six muscle groups was measured using a hand-held dynamometer. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Results:  A total of 16 licensed dental hygienists (n=16) and 16 participants with no history of using tools/devices repetitively for work (n=16), comprised the experimental and control groups, repectively. The control group generated greater muscle force than the experimental group for the  abductor pollicis longus  ( p =0.045). Significant differences were identified when comparing the low mobile phone users in the experimental group to the control group for the  flexor pollicis brevis  ( p =0.031),  abductor pollicis longus  ( p =0.031), and  flexor digitorum  ( p =0.006), with the control group demonstrating higher muscle force. Years in clinical practice and mobile phone use was shown to have a significant effect on muscular force generation for the  flexor pollicis brevis  ( F =3.645,  df =3,  p =0.020) and  flexor digitorum  ( F =3.560,  df =3,  p =0.022); subjects who practiced dental hygiene the longest produced the least amount of muscle force. Conclusion:  Results from this pilot study indicate there are no significant additive effects of cell phone use and dental hygiene practice on finger muscles used for instrumentation. However, results indicate that dental hygiene practice demonstrated significant effects on muscular strength as compared to individuals who do not use tools/devices repetitively for work.

465,32354905,A German Study Comparing Standard Wire Localization With Magnetic Seed Localization of Non-palpable Breast Lesions.,"BACKGROUND


Exact localization of non-palpable breast lesions is necessary to ensure that the correct lesion is removed. Conventional methods come with several disadvantages.
PATIENTS AND METHODS


We compared 28 patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery for a non-palpable lesion. By surgeon choice, 14 patients were assigned to undergo magnetic seed localization and 14 underwent standard wire localization. The primary outcome was the operative time, and secondary outcome was the patient pain level.
RESULTS


The mean age was 52±10 (SD) years in the seed arm, and 55±13 years in the wire arm. The median time from skin incision to tumor extraction was not significantly different between the two groups. Patients in the wire localized group significantly more often reported pain during coughing/breathing, movement, and sleep.
CONCLUSION

466,32349779,"CEOP/IVE/GDP alternating regimen compared with CEOP as the first-line therapy for newly diagnosed patients with peripheral T cell lymphoma: results from a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial.","BACKGROUND


Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP)/CHOP-like chemotherapy is widely used in peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL). Here we conducted a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, comparing the efficacy and safety of CEOP/IVE/GDP alternating regimen with CEOP in newly diagnosed PTCL.
METHODS


PTCL patients, except for anaplastic large cell lymphoma-anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive, were 1:1 randomly assigned to receive CEOP/IVE/GDP (CEOP, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m 2 , epirubicin 70 mg/m 2 , vincristine 1.4 mg/m 2  [maximum 2 mg] on day 1, and prednisone 60 mg/m 2  [maximum 100 mg] on days 1-5 every 21 days, at the first and fourth cycle; IVE, ifosfamide 2000 mg/m 2  on days 1-3, epirubicin 70 mg/m 2  on day 1, and etoposide 100 mg/m 2  on days 1-3 every 21 days, at the second and fifth cycle; and GDP, gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2  on days 1 and 8, cisplatin 25 mg/m 2  on days 1-3, and dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1-4 every 21 days, at the third and sixth cycle) and CEOP (every 21 days for 6 cycles). Analysis of efficacy and safety was of the intent-to-treatment population. The primary endpoint was a complete response rate at the end of treatment. Meanwhile, whole exome sequencing and targeted sequencing were performed in 62 patients with available tumor samples to explore prognostic biomarkers in this cohort as an exploratory post hoc analysis.
RESULTS


Among 106 patients, 53 each were enrolled to CEOP/IVE/GDP and CEOP. With 51 evaluable patients each in two groups, a complete response rate of the CEOP/IVE/GDP group was similar to that of the CEOP group (37.3% vs. 31.4%, p = 0.532). There was no difference in median progression-free survival (PFS; 15.4 months vs. 9.2 months, p = 0.122) or overall survival (OS; 24.3 months vs. 21.9 months, p = 0.178). Grade 3-4 hematological and non-hematological adverse events were comparable. Histone modification genes were most frequently mutated (25/62, 40.3%), namely KMT2D, KMT2A, SETD2, EP300, and CREBBP. Multivariate analysis indicated that CREBBP and IDH2 mutations were independent factors predicting poor PFS and OS (all p < 0.001), while KMT2D predicting poor PFS (p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS


CEOP/IVE/GDP alternating regimen showed no remission or survival advantage to standard chemotherapy. Future clinical trials should aim to develop alternative regimen targeting disease biology as demonstrated by recurrent mutations in epigenetic factors.

467,32349789,Increasing uptake of evidence-based screening services though a community health worker-delivered multimodality program: study protocol for a randomized pragmatic trial.,"BACKGROUND


Underserved ethnic minority populations experience significant disparities in HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), colorectal cancer (CRC), and cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Much of the excess burden of these diseases among underserved communities is due to lack of preventive care, including screening. Barriers to disease screening include low awareness, lack of access to care and health insurance, and cultural beliefs regarding disease prevention. Our current trial aims to examine community health worker (CHW)-delivered, home-based multi-modality screening for HIV, HCV, CRC, and cervical cancer simultaneously.
DESIGN


We are conducting a randomized pragmatic trial among 900 Haitian, Hispanic, and African-American participants from diverse underserved communities in South Florida. People between the ages of 50 and 65 who have not had appropriate HIV, HCV, CRC, and cervical cancer screening per United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations are eligible for the study. Participants are recruited by CHWs and complete a structured interview to assess multilevel determinants of disease risk. Participants are then randomized to receive HIV, HCV, CRC, and cervical cancer screening via navigation to care by a CHW (Group 1) or via CHW-delivered home-based screening (Group 2). The primary outcome is completion of screening for each of these diseases within 6 months post-enrollment.
DISCUSSION


Our trial is among the first to examine the effectiveness of a CHW-delivered, multimodality, home-based disease-screening approach. If found to be effective, this approach may represent a cost-effective strategy for disease screening within underserved and underscreened minority groups.

469,32349893,Açaí (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) and juçara (Euterpe edulis Mart.) juices improved HDL-c levels and antioxidant defense of healthy adults in a 4-week randomized cross-over study.,"OBJECTIVE


To evaluate the effects of moderate-term açaí and juçara juice intake on fasting glucose, lipid profile, and oxidative stress biomarkers in healthy subjects.
METHODS


A randomized cross-over study was performed with 30 healthy adults. The subjects were assigned to drink 200 mL/day of açaí or juçara juice for four weeks with a 4-week washout period. Before and after each nutritional intervention, blood samples were obtained to evaluate the outcomes: fasting glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c), small, dense LDL-c (sd-LDL-c), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant status (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI), uric acid, and activity of the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx).
RESULTS


After four weeks, açaí and juçara juices increased the concentrations of HDL-c by 7.7% and 11.4%, respectively (P < 0.05). In addition, açaí juice intake promoted significant increases in TAC (66.7%), CAT (275.1%), GPx (15.3%), and a decrease in OSI (55.7%) compared to baseline (P < 0.05 for all). Juçara juice intake significantly increased CAT activity (~15.0%) in relation to baseline. No significant intergroup differences were observed for any outcomes (P > 0.05).

470,32349922,Kinematic and kinetic comparison between American and Japanese collegiate pitchers.,"OBJECTIVES


Understanding the differences in baseball pitching biomechanics between American and Japanese pitchers may help with training and developing these athletes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the kinematic and kinetic differences in collegiate baseball pitchers from United States of American and Japan.
DESIGN


Controlled laboratory study.
METHODS


Data were analyzed for 11 American and 11 Japanese collegiate pitchers throwing fastballs using 3D motion capture (480Hz).
RESULTS


The Americans were heavier (95±7kg vs 81±7kg), taller (189±3cm vs 180±6cm), and had faster ball velocity (39±1m/s vs 35±2m/s). By the end of arm cocking phase, the American pitchers had rotated their shoulder to a greater degree (p=0.021, d=1.5) and at ball release the Japanese had greater knee flexion (p=0.020, d=1.2). American pitchers exhibited greater peak kinetics on the throwing arm; however, when normalized for height and weight only three differences remained.
CONCLUSION


The differences found between the American and Japanese players could contribute to the increased ball velocity in the American pitchers. Additionally, throwing arm peak kinetics were greater in the American pitchers which may help generate greater ball velocity; however, increased kinetics may also lead to increased risk of injury.",2020,"American pitchers exhibited greater peak kinetics on the throwing arm; however, when normalized for height and weight only three differences remained.

471,32350320,Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation Improves Stair Climbing Capacity in People with Knee Osteoarthritis.,"This study aimed to examine the effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) on stair climbing capacity in individuals with pre-radiographic to mild knee osteoarthritis (OA). This is a secondary analysis of data from a single, participant-blinded, randomized controlled trial with a pre-post design. Participants with pre-radiographic to mild knee OA (mean age, 59.1 years; 72.9% women) were randomly assigned into two groups, a TENS (n = 30) and a sham-TENS groups (n = 29). TENS or sham-TENS treatments were applied to all participants by using the prototype TENS device with pre-specified parameters. The primary outcome measures included valid and reliable functional measures for stair climbing (stair-climb test [SCT]), visual analog scale for knee pain during the SCT, and quadriceps muscle strength. TENS improved SCT time by 0.41 s (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.07, 0.75). The time reduction in the transition phase explains the TENS therapeutic effect. Post-hoc correlation analyses revealed a non-significant but positive relationship between the pain relief effect and improved 11-step SCT time in the TENS group but not in the sham-TENS group. These results indicate that the TENS intervention may be an option for reducing the burden of early-stage knee OA.",2020,"TENS improved SCT time by 0.41 s (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.07, 0.75).","['People with Knee Osteoarthritis', 'individuals with pre-radiographic to mild knee osteoarthritis (OA', 'Participants with pre-radiographic to mild knee OA (mean age, 59.1 years; 72.9% women']","['TENS', 'Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation', 'TENS intervention', 'TENS or sham-TENS', 'transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS', 'sham-TENS']","['burden of early-stage knee OA', 'SCT time', 'valid and reliable functional measures for stair climbing (stair-climb test [SCT]), visual analog scale for knee pain during the SCT, and quadriceps muscle strength', 'pain relief effect and improved 11-step SCT time', 'stair climbing capacity']","[{'cui': 'C0027361', 'cui_str': 'Person'}, {'cui': 'C0409959', 'cui_str': 'Osteoarthritis of knee'}, {'cui': 'C0032952', 'cui_str': 'Prednisone'}, {'cui': 'C0444708', 'cui_str': 'Radiographic'}, {'cui': 'C1513302', 'cui_str': 'Common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 1'}, {'cui': 'C0029408', 'cui_str': 'Degenerative polyarthritis'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0043210', 'cui_str': 'Woman'}]","[{'cui': 'C0040654', 'cui_str': 'Percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation'}, {'cui': 'C0184661', 'cui_str': 'Procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0073980', 'cui_str': 'salicylhydroxamic acid'}]","[{'cui': 'C2363430', 'cui_str': 'Early stage'}, {'cui': 'C0409959', 'cui_str': 'Osteoarthritis of knee'}, {'cui': 'C0796149', 'cui_str': 'Scott syndrome'}, {'cui': 'C0040223', 'cui_str': 'Time'}, {'cui': 'C0205245', 'cui_str': 'Functional'}, {'cui': 'C0079809', 'cui_str': 'Measure'}, {'cui': 'C1290942', 'cui_str': 'Climbing stairs'}, {'cui': 'C0432601', 'cui_str': 'Stairs climbed'}, {'cui': 'C0003647', 'cui_str': 'Aptitude Tests'}, {'cui': 'C0042815', 'cui_str': 'Visual analog pain scale'}, {'cui': 'C0231749', 'cui_str': 'Knee pain'}, {'cui': 'C0517349', 'cui_str': 'Muscle Strength'}, {'cui': 'C0451615', 'cui_str': 'Pain relief'}, {'cui': 'C1280500', 'cui_str': 'Effect'}, {'cui': 'C0184511', 'cui_str': 'Improved'}, {'cui': 'C0427149', 'cui_str': 'Foot-drop gait'}]",,0.0636887,"TENS improved SCT time by 0.41 s (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.07, 0.75).","[{'ForeName': 'Hirotaka', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Iijima', 'Affiliation': 'Department of System Design Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan. iijima.hirotaka.4m@yt.sd.keio.ac.jp.'}, {'ForeName': 'Ryo', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Eguchi', 'Affiliation': 'School of Science for Open and Environmental Systems, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kanako', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Shimoura', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy, Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Keisuke', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Yamada', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy, Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Tomoki', 'Initials': 'T', 'LastName': 'Aoyama', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy, Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Masaki', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Takahashi', 'Affiliation': 'Department of System Design Engineering, Faculty of Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan.'}]",Scientific reports,['10.1038/s41598-020-64176-0']
472,32350413,Scheduling nab-paclitaxel combined with gemcitabine as first-line treatment for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.,"BACKGROUND


Nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (nabP+gemcitabine) offers modest survival gains for patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Sequential scheduling of nabP+gemcitabine in a PDAC mouse model improved efficacy; this hypothesis was tested in a clinical trial.
METHODS


Patients with previously untreated metastatic PDAC were randomised to receive nabP+gemcitabine administered either concomitantly on the same day, or sequentially, with gemcitabine administered 24 h after nabP. The primary outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), safety, quality of life (QoL) and predictive biomarkers.
RESULTS


In total, 71 patients received sequential (SEQ) and 75 concomitant (CON) treatment. Six-month PFS was 46% with SEQ and 32% with CON scheduling. Median PFS (5.6 versus 4.0 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.47-0.95, p = 0.022) and ORR (52% versus 31%, p = 0.023) favoured the SEQ arm; median OS was 10.2 versus 8.2 months (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.65-1.33, p = 0.70). CTCAE Grade ≥3 neutropaenia incidence doubled with SEQ therapy but was not detrimental to QoL. Strongly positive tumour epithelial cytidine deaminase (CDA) expression favoured benefit from SEQ therapy (PFS HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.13-0.70).
CONCLUSIONS


SEQ delivery of nabP+gemcitabine improved PFS and ORR, with manageable toxicity, but did not significantly improve OS.

473,32350452,A 12-month prospective study to evaluate the efficacy of using the treat-and-extend regimen with intravitreal aflibercept as a Second-Line Treatment for Diabetic Macular Oedema (the TADI Study).,"PURPOSE


To evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal aflibercept as a second-line therapy in eyes with persistent diabetic macular oedema (DMO) despite receiving initial bevacizumab treatment.
METHODS


A prospective multicentre study was conducted in nine academic clinics in Israel. Starting from the first follow-up visit, a treat-and-extend regimen was applied in which the treatment intervals were extended by 2 weeks based on macular thickness using SD-OCT. The primary outcome was central subfield thickness (CST) at week 52.
RESULTS


Forty-four patients (n = 48 eyes) were recruited to the study, and 43 eyes completed 52 weeks of follow-up. Patients received a mean (±SD) of 7.9 ± 3.5 bevacizumab injections before enrolment. The mean (±SD) CST under aflibercept therapy decreased from 468 ± 131 μm at baseline to 303 ± 67 μm at 52 weeks (p = 0.002), and best corrected visual acuity improved from 64 ± 15 ETDRS letters at baseline to 75 ± 8 letters at week 52 (p = 0.001). Twenty (46%) eyes met the treat-and-extend criteria and received a mean (±SD) of 10.9 ± 2 aflibercept injections.
CONCLUSIONS


Eyes with persistent DMO following initial bevacizumab therapy had a marked reduction in macular thickness and improved visual acuity following 1 year of treatment with intravitreal aflibercept. Less than half of the patients met eligibility criteria for extension of the treatment interval; for these patients, the treat-and-extend regimen resulted in a maximum treatment interval of 10 weeks during the first year.",2020,"The mean (±SD) CST under aflibercept therapy decreased from 468 ± 131 μm at baseline to 303 ± 67 μm at 52 weeks (p = 0.002), and best corrected visual acuity improved from 64 ± 15 ETDRS letters at baseline to 75 ± 8 letters at week 52 (p = 0.001).","['Forty-four patients (n\u2009=\u200948 eyes) were recruited to the study, and 43 eyes completed 52 weeks of follow-up', 'eyes with persistent diabetic macular oedema (DMO) despite receiving initial bevacizumab treatment', 'Diabetic Macular Oedema (the TADI Study', 'nine academic clinics in Israel', 'Twenty (46%) eyes met the treat-and-extend criteria and received a mean (±SD) of 10.9\u2009±\u20092 aflibercept injections']","['bevacizumab therapy', 'intravitreal aflibercept', 'bevacizumab']","['mean (±SD) CST under aflibercept therapy', 'corrected visual acuity', 'central subfield thickness (CST', 'macular thickness and improved visual acuity']","[{'cui': 'C4319568', 'cui_str': '44'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0015392', 'cui_str': 'Eye structure'}, {'cui': 'C0008972', 'cui_str': 'Clinical Study'}, {'cui': 'C0205197', 'cui_str': 'Complete'}, {'cui': 'C0439230', 'cui_str': 'week'}, {'cui': 'C0589120', 'cui_str': 'Follow-up status'}, {'cui': 'C0332996', 'cui_str': 'Persistent embryonic structure'}, {'cui': 'C0730285', 'cui_str': 'Macular edema due to diabetes mellitus'}, {'cui': 'C0205265', 'cui_str': 'Initial'}, {'cui': 'C0796392', 'cui_str': 'bevacizumab'}, {'cui': 'C0039798', 'cui_str': 'therapy'}, {'cui': 'C0002424', 'cui_str': 'Ambulatory care site'}, {'cui': 'C0022271', 'cui_str': 'Israel'}, {'cui': 'C0025646', 'cui_str': 'Methionine'}, {'cui': 'C0087111', 'cui_str': 'Therapeutic procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0231448', 'cui_str': 'Extension'}, {'cui': 'C0243161', 'cui_str': 'criteria'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C4050106', 'cui_str': 'aflibercept Injection'}]","[{'cui': 'C0796392', 'cui_str': 'bevacizumab'}, {'cui': 'C0013216', 'cui_str': 'Drug therapy'}, {'cui': 'C1517572', 'cui_str': 'Intravitreal route'}, {'cui': 'C1134659', 'cui_str': 'aflibercept'}]","[{'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0205099', 'cui_str': 'Central'}, {'cui': 'C1280412', 'cui_str': 'Thick'}, {'cui': 'C1134659', 'cui_str': 'aflibercept'}, {'cui': 'C0013216', 'cui_str': 'Drug therapy'}, {'cui': 'C1275680', 'cui_str': 'Corrected visual acuity'}, {'cui': 'C0184511', 'cui_str': 'Improved'}, {'cui': 'C0042812', 'cui_str': 'Visual acuity'}]",,0.0530797,"The mean (±SD) CST under aflibercept therapy decreased from 468 ± 131 μm at baseline to 303 ± 67 μm at 52 weeks (p = 0.002), and best corrected visual acuity improved from 64 ± 15 ETDRS letters at baseline to 75 ± 8 letters at week 52 (p = 0.001).","[{'ForeName': 'Liran', 'Initials': 'L', 'LastName': 'Tiosano', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, and the Hebrew University -

474,32350598,Comparison of aspirating pipettes and hysteroscopy with curettage.,"PURPOSE


In this prospective study, endometrial biopsy by pipette was compared with hysteroscopy with curettage in patients with an abnormal uterine bleeding (ABU) (hypermenorrhea, intermediate bleeding, continuous bleeding, postmenopausal bleeding) and patients with a sonographically abnormal endometrium.
METHODS


176 patients were included. The pipette samples were taken during the usual planned procedure under general anaesthesia. Thereafter, the planned hysteroscopy with curettage was completed. The study was performed as a double-blind study. The obtained histologies (of pipelle and curettage) were sent separately to the same pathologist. The pipelle material was encoded by a specific number without any patient data.
RESULTS


In 97% of the cases using the biopsy with pipette were obtained an adequate sample. The biopsy with pipette had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% in the diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma and atypical hyperplasia. Pipette showed a significantly lower accuracy with a sensitivity of 28% in the diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia without atypia. Pipette showed the lowest sensitivity for polyps, myomas and atrophic endometrium.
CONCLUSION


The study shows that pipette sampling is a safe, accurate, low-cost ambulatory procedure with high sensitivity for the detection of atypical endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma.

475,32350650,"Consideration of eyeball length and prismatic side-effects of spectacle lenses in strabismus surgery-a randomised, double-blind interventional study.","PURPOSE


Potential sources of error in dosage planning in strabismus surgery are (a) prismatic side-effects of spectacle lenses when measuring the preoperative angle with the alternating prism cover test and (b) a potential influence of eye ball axial length on dose response. As both errors take effect in opposite directions, many strabismus surgeons set aside their consideration. This study investigates whether considering both factors for dosage planning yields better operative results.
METHODS


In this prospective, randomised, double-blind, interventional pilot study, we included patients scheduled for purely horizontal strabismus surgery and determined each patient's surgical dose (total amount of recession/plication) either with (study group) or without (control) consideration of the two factors. The deviation of the resulting angle from the target angle 3 months postoperatively was the primary endpoint.
RESULTS


One hundred one patients were included, 51 of which in the intervention group and 50 in the control group. The primary endpoint showed a median deviation from the target of 3.0° in the intervention group and 4.8° in the control group. We observed a group difference of 1.8° in favour of the intervention group (p = 0.053). Subgroup analysis showed a difference between groups of 2.2° for esotropic patients and of 5.1° for patients with hyperopia > + 2 D.
CONCLUSION


Taking prismatic side-effects of spectacle lenses and eye ball length into account when calculating strabismus surgery doses showed a trend towards more accurate results. Esotropic patients and patients with hyperopia > + 2 D seemed to benefit most.

476,32350670,Lipid microsphere bound oxycodone for pain management in patients receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancer.,"BACKGROUND


Wax microsphere bound oxycodone was developed as an abuse-deterrent opioid and maintains a similar pharmacokinetic profile whether administered with or without an intact capsule. We hypothesized that microsphere oxycodone could be utilized for extended release analgesia in patients undergoing radiation (RT) for head-and-neck cancer (HNC) and would not need to be discontinued due to dysphagia or gastrostomy tube dependence.
METHODS AND MATERIALS


We performed a prospective trial that enrolled participants > 18 years with histologically confirmed HNC who were scheduled to receive RT. Analgesia was prescribed in accordance with the WHO pain ladder. Microsphere oxycodone was initiated when total daily opioid dose exceeded 30 mg of morphine sulfate equivalent and was titrated weekly during RT. Pain level and effect on quality of life were assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory. The primary feasibility endpoint was frequency of microsphere oxycodone discontinuation within 3 months of RT for reasons other than pain resolution.
RESULTS


Twenty-six eligible patients were enrolled. Microsphere oxycodone was initiated in 16 (61.5%) patients. Six (23.1%) patients utilized a gastrostomy tube to administer microsphere oxycodone during all or part of RT. Microsphere oxycodone was discontinued in 1 (7.6%) patient due to perceived inefficacy. No patients were discontinued due to toxicity or difficulty with administration. Ratings for average pain was 3.1 (± 3.4) at enrollment, 4.0 (± 2.4) at week 6 of RT, and 1.8 (± 2.2) at 3-month follow-up.

477,32350735,Polytetrafluoroethylene versus polypropylene mesh during laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair of inguinal hernia: short- and long-term results of a double-blind clinical randomized controlled trial.,"PURPOSE


Aim of the study is to compare macroporous (> 1 mm 2 ) polytetrafluoroethylene mesh (LP-PTFE) versus microporous (< 1 mm 2 ) polypropylene mesh (SP-PPL) in terms of postoperative acute and chronic discomfort and pain, difficulty in mesh handling and long-term recurrence rate.
METHODS


Fifty-two patients with bilateral hernia were enrolled in this double-blind randomized controlled trial (NCT02023203). Each hernia, in the same patient, was randomized to implant LP-PTFE or SP-PPL mesh during totally extraperitoneal laparoscopic hernia repair. Patients were followed at 7 days, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 60 months after surgery. Visual analog scale (VAS) score was employed to evaluate the outcomes. Student's t test was used in case of normally distributed continuous variables, while the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used in case of not normally distributed variables. Chi square test was used for analysis of categorical variables.
RESULTS


Median VAS discomfort score with SP-PPL was significantly higher than LP-PTFE at 1 and 3 months after surgery (p = 0.003 in both cases). LP-PTFE showed significantly lower median score than SP-PPL at 7 days after surgery (p = 0.025) regarding pain at movement. Testicular pain was lower in case of LP-PTFE than SP-PPL at 7 days, 1 and 3 months after surgery (p = 0.005, p = 0.004 and p = 0.004, respectively). LP-PTFE was significantly more difficult to handle (p = 0.001). At 60 months, one recurrence was observed in the LP-PTFE group (p = 1.0000).
CONCLUSIONS


LP-PTFE has less postoperative discomfort and pain up to 3 months after surgery, without differences after that period, although it shows more difficulty in handling and recurrences occur even if not statistically significant.",2020,"Testicular pain was lower in case of LP-PTFE than SP-PPL at 7 days, 1 and 3 months after surgery (p = 0.005, p = 0.004 and p = 0.004, respectively).",['Fifty-two patients with bilateral hernia'],"['macroporous (>\u20091\xa0mm 2 ) polytetrafluoroethylene mesh (LP-PTFE) versus microporous (<\u20091\xa0mm 2 ) polypropylene mesh (SP-PPL', 'implant LP-PTFE or SP-PPL mesh', 'laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair of inguinal hernia', 'extraperitoneal laparoscopic hernia repair', 'Polytetrafluoroethylene versus polypropylene mesh', 'LP-PTFE']","['Visual analog scale (VAS) score', 'postoperative acute and chronic discomfort and pain, difficulty in mesh handling and long-term recurrence rate', 'postoperative discomfort and pain', 'recurrence', 'LP-PTFE', 'Median VAS discomfort score with SP-PPL', 'Testicular pain']","[{'cui': 'C4319570', 'cui_str': '52'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0238767', 'cui_str': 'Right and left'}, {'cui': 'C0019270', 'cui_str': 'Hernia'}]","[{'cui': 'C4280965', 'cui_str': 'Greater than one'}, {'cui': 'C0032611', 'cui_str': 'Polytetrafluoroethylene'}, {'cui': 'C0181805', 'cui_str': 'Mesh'}, {'cui': 'C1321585', 'cui_str': 'Polypropylene mesh'}, {'cui': 'C0021102', 'cui_str': 'Implant'}, {'cui': 'C0031150', 'cui_str': 'Laparoscopy'}, {'cui': 'C0442090', 'cui_str': 'Extraperitoneal'}, {'cui': 'C0021446', 'cui_str': 'Repair of inguinal hernia'}, {'cui': 'C0019328', 'cui_str': 'Hernia repair'}]","[{'cui': 'C0042815', 'cui_str': 'Visual analog pain scale'}, {'cui': 'C0449820', 'cui_str': 'Score'}, {'cui': 'C0032790', 'cui_str': 'Postoperative period'}, {'cui': 'C0205178', 'cui_str': 'Acuteness'}, {'cui': 'C0205191', 'cui_str': 'Chronic'}, {'cui': 'C2364135', 'cui_str': 'Discomfort'}, {'cui': 'C0030193', 'cui_str': 'Pain'}, {'cui': 'C1299586', 'cui_str': 'Difficulty'}, {'cui': 'C0181805', 'cui_str': 'Mesh'}, {'cui': 'C0205166', 'cui_str': 'Long'}, {'cui': 'C0233324', 'cui_str': 'Term birth of newborn'}, {'cui': 'C0034897', 'cui_str': 'Recurrence'}, {'cui': 'C0032611', 'cui_str': 'Polytetrafluoroethylene'}, {'cui': 'C0549183', 'cui_str': 'Midline'}, {'cui': 'C0039591', 'cui_str': 'Pain in testicle'}]",52.0,0.403041,"Testicular pain was lower in case of LP-PTFE than SP-PPL at 7 days, 1 and 3 months after surgery (p = 0.005, p = 0.004 and p = 0.004, respectively).","[{'ForeName': 'I', 'Initials': 'I', 'LastName': 'Alarcón', 'Affiliation': 'Unit of Innovation in Minimally Invasive Surgery, Department of General and Digestive Surgery, University Hospital ""Virgen del Rocio"", University of Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'A', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Balla', 'Affiliation': 'Unit of Innovation in Minimally Invasive Surgery, Department of General and Digestive Surgery, University Hospital ""Virgen del Rocio"", University of Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain. andrea.balla@gmail.com.'}, {'ForeName': 'J R', 'Initials': 'JR', 'LastName': 'Soler Frías', 'Affiliation': 'Unit of Innovation in Minimally Invasive Surgery, Department of General and Digestive Surgery, University Hospital ""Virgen del Rocio"", University of Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'A', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Barranco', 'Affiliation': 'Unit of Innovation in Minimally Invasive Surgery, Department of General and Digestive Surgery, University Hospital ""Virgen del Rocio"", University of Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'J', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Bellido Luque', 'Affiliation': 'Unit of General and Digestive Surgery, Hospital Quironsalud Sagrado Corazón, Sevilla, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'S', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Morales-Conde', 'Affiliation': 'Unit of Innovation in Minimally Invasive Surgery, Department of General and Digestive Surgery, University Hospital ""Virgen del Rocio"", University of Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain.'}]",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,['10.1007/s10029-020-02200-y']
478,32350749,A Phase II Randomized Trial to Explore the Potential for Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interactions with Stiripentol or Valproate when Combined with Cannabidiol in Patients with Epilepsy.,"BACKGROUND


In recent randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trials, highly purified cannabidiol demonstrated efficacy with an acceptable safety profile in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome. It is anticipated that antiepileptic drugs such as stiripentol and valproate will be administered concomitantly with cannabidiol.
OBJECTIVES


This trial evaluated the effect of cannabidiol on steady-state pharmacokinetics of stiripentol or valproate in patients with epilepsy, and the safety and tolerability of cannabidiol.
METHODS


This phase II, two-arm, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial recruited male and female patients with epilepsy aged 16-55 years. Patients receiving a stable dose of stiripentol or valproate were randomized 4:1 to receive concomitant double-blind cannabidiol or placebo. Patients received plant-derived, highly purified cannabidiol medicine (Epidiolex ®  in the USA; Epidyolex ®  in the EU; 100 mg/mL oral solution) at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day from day 12 to 26, following a 10-day dose-escalation period. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluations were collected on days 1 and 26 before stiripentol/valproate dosing and up to 12 h postdose. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were recorded.
RESULTS


In total, 35 patients were recruited to the stiripentol arm (n = 14) or the valproate arm (n = 21). Both the safety and the pharmacokinetic populations of the stiripentol arm comprised 14 patients (2 placebo; 12 cannabidiol). The safety population of the valproate arm comprised 20 patients (4 placebo; 16 cannabidiol; one withdrew before receiving treatment); the pharmacokinetic population comprised 15 patients (3 placebo; 12 cannabidiol). Concomitant cannabidiol led to a small increase in stiripentol exposure (17% increase in maximum observed plasma concentration [C max ]; 30% increase in area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval [AUC tau ]). Concomitant cannabidiol also had little effect on valproate exposure (13% decrease in C max ; 17% decrease in AUC tau ) or its metabolite, 2-propyl-4-pentenoic acid (4-ene-VPA) (23% decrease in C max ; 30% decrease in AUC tau ). All changes in exposure are expressed as the dose-normalized geometric mean (CV%) day 26 to day 1 ratio. The most common AE was diarrhea; most AEs were mild. Two patients discontinued cannabidiol because of serious AEs (rash [n = 1] in the stiripentol arm; hypertransaminasemia [n = 1] in the valproate arm). A separate in vitro study investigated the bidirectional effect of cannabidiol, or its metabolite 7-carboxy-cannabidiol, on valproate plasma protein binding; no change in plasma protein binding was observed for either compound.
CONCLUSIONS


The clinical relevance of the increase in stiripentol exposure is unknown; patients receiving cannabidiol and stiripentol concomitantly should be monitored for adverse reactions as individual patient responses may vary. Coadministration of cannabidiol did not affect the pharmacokinetics of valproate or its metabolite, 4-ene-VPA, in adult patients with epilepsy. Safety results were consistent with the known safety profile of cannabidiol at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day.

479,32355632,VAST Clinical Trial: Safely Supplementing Tissue Lost to Degenerative Disc Disease.,"Background


The function of the intervertebral disc is structural. Loss of tissue alters biomechanics, leads to subsequent disc degeneration, and is attributable to discogenic pain. A viable structural allograft was delivered into degenerate discs to determine whether intervention could safely stabilize anatomy, reduce pain, and improve function.
Methods


Following institutional review board approval and patient consent, subjects were randomized to receive allograft or saline at either 1 or 2 levels or continue nonsurgical management (NSM). Data were collected at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Back pain with a visual analog scale (VAS) and disability by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were assessed, as were adverse events. This trial is registered on http://www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03709901).
Results


At 6 and 12 months, the VAS improved from 54.81, 55.25, and 62.255 in the allograft, saline, and NSM subjects, respectively, to 16.0 and 41.0 in the allograft and saline groups at 6 months, and 12.27 and 19.67, respectively, at 12 months. All subjects in the NSM cohort crossed over to allograft treatment. At 6 and 12 months, ODI improved from 53.73, 49.25, and 55.75 in the allograft, saline, and NSM subjects, respectively, to 18.47 and 28.75 in the allograft and saline groups 1 and 2 at 6 months, and 15.67 and 9.33, respectively, at 12 months. At 3 months the ODI of the NSM group was 62.75 and subjects reached 19.0 and 11.0 at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Adverse events were transient and resolved in all cohorts.
Conclusions


This study is supported by data demonstrating that improved pain and function at 12 months can be attained with a supplemental viable disc matrix. Subjects receiving the VIA Disc Matrix achieved improvements that were durable at 12 months.

480,32355668,Testing Distinct Three-Dimensional Effects in Laparoscopy: A Prospective Randomized Trial Using the Lübecker Toolbox Curriculum.,"Background


The use of stereoscopic laparoscopic systems in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) allows a three-dimensional (3D) view of the surgical field, which improves hand-eye coordination. Depending on the stereo base used in the construction of the endoscopes, 3D systems may differ regarding the 3D effect. Our aim was to investigate the influence of different stereo bases on the 3D effect.
Methods


This was a prospective randomized study involving 42 MIS-inexperienced study participants. We evaluated two laparoscopic 3D systems with stereo bases of 2.5 mm (system A) and 3.8 mm (system B) for differences in learning MIS skills using the Lübeck Toolbox (LTB) video box trainer. We evaluated participants' performance regarding the times and repetitions required to reach each exercise's goal. After completing the final exercise (""suturing""), participants performed the exercise again using a two-dimensional (2D) representation. Additionally, we retrospectively compared our study results with a preliminary study from participants completing the LTB curriculum with a 2D system.
Results


The median number of repetitions until reaching the goals for LTB exercises 1, 2, 3, and 6 for system A were: 18 (range 7-53), 24 (range 8-46), 24 (range 13-51), and 21 (range 10-46), respectively, and for system B were: 12 (range 2-30), 16 (range 6-43), 17 (range 4-47), and 15 (range 6-29), respectively ( p  = not significant). Changing from a 3D to a 2D representation after completing the learning curve led to a longer average time required, from 95.22 to 119.3 s ( p  < 0.0001), for the last exercise (exercise 6; ""suturing""). When comparing the results retrospectively with the learning curves acquired with the 2D system, there was a significant reduction in the number of repetitions required to reach the LTB exercise goals for exercises 1, 3, and 6 using the 3D system.

481,32355724,Effect of high flow nasal cannula on peripheral muscle oxygenation and hemodynamic during paddling exercise in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a randomized controlled trial.,"Background


Exercise training for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) improves their endurance and oxygenation. Supplemental oxygen delivered by high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) reportedly improves the clinical outcomes during high-intensity exercise. However, the physical benefits of the provision of supplemental oxygen with HFNC for the improvement of exercise performance have not been fully investigated. This randomized trial aimed to evaluate the effect of HFNC on the hemodynamic status and peripheral muscle microcirculation during exercise training.
Methods


In this multicenter, randomized controlled parallel two-group study, 32 patients with moderate to severe COPD were randomly assigned into the nasal cannula (NC) group (n=15) with a flow rate of 2-3 L/min or the HFNC group (n=17) with a flow rate of 45 L/min for twelve 40 min exercise training sessions.
Results


The mean cardiac index (CI) and stroke volume (SV) of the NC group in the first session were significantly lower than those of the HFNC group (3.68±0.76  vs.  4.5±0.76 L/min/m 2 , P=0.014; 63.03±9.87  vs . 74.22±19.48, P=0.002, respectively). The systemic vascular resistance (SVR) of the NC group was significantly lower in the seventh session than in the first session (891±287  vs . 1,138±381 dyn-s/cm 5 , respectively, P=0.048). The mean deoxyhemoglobin level was higher in the HFNC group in the 1 st  session and lower in the 12 th  session (1.09±9.04  vs . 7.3±7.3 µm, P=0.046). The COPD Assessment Test score, Modified Medical Research Council scale score, maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), and maximum expiratory pressure were different within and between the groups.
Conclusions


HFNC, with a lower oxygen concentration than that used with a traditional NC, yielded lower deoxygenated hemoglobin levels after 12 suboptimal exercise training sessions. In contrast, the higher oxygen concentration delivered by NC reduced SVR. The COPD assessment score improved on exercise training, regardless of the supplemental oxygen delivery method.",2020,The systemic vascular resistance (SVR) of the NC group was significantly lower in the seventh session than in the first session (891±287  vs .,"['patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease', 'patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD', '32 patients with moderate to severe COPD']","['paddling exercise', '\n\n\nExercise training', 'Supplemental oxygen delivered by high flow nasal cannula (HFNC', 'high flow nasal cannula', 'nasal cannula (NC) group (n=15) with a flow rate of 2-3 L/min or the HFNC group (n=17) with a flow rate of 45 L/min for twelve 40 min exercise training sessions', 'HFNC']","['COPD Assessment Test score, Modified Medical Research Council scale score, maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), and maximum expiratory pressure', 'peripheral muscle oxygenation and hemodynamic', 'deoxygenated hemoglobin levels', 'systemic vascular resistance (SVR', 'higher oxygen concentration delivered by NC reduced SVR', 'mean deoxyhemoglobin level', 'COPD assessment score', 'mean cardiac index (CI) and stroke volume (SV', 'hemodynamic status and peripheral muscle microcirculation']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0024117', 'cui_str': 'Chronic obstructive lung disease'}, {'cui': 'C1299393', 'cui_str': 'Moderate to severe'}]","[{'cui': 'C0015259', 'cui_str': 'Exercise'}, {'cui': 'C4279936', 'cui_str': 'Exercise Training'}, {'cui': 'C0030054', 'cui_str': 'Oxygen'}, {'cui': 'C0205250', 'cui_str': 'High'}, {'cui': 'C0179574', 'cui_str': 'Nasal Cannulae'}, {'cui': 'C0439745', 'cui_str': 'Grouped'}, {'cui': 'C0439393', 'cui_str': 'L/min'}, {'cui': 'C0439232', 'cui_str': 'min'}]","[{'cui': 'C2960692', 'cui_str': 'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease assessment test score'}, {'cui': 'C0392747', 'cui_str': 'Changing'}, {'cui': 'C0079816', 'cui_str': 'Research, Medical'}, {'cui': 'C0175659', 'cui_str': 'Scale'}, {'cui': 'C0449820', 'cui_str': 'Score'}, {'cui': 'C0232021', 'cui_str': 'Peak inspiratory pressure'}, {'cui': 'C0232022', 'cui_str': 'Peak expiratory pressure'}, {'cui': 'C0205100', 'cui_str': 'Peripheral'}, {'cui': 'C0026845', 'cui_str': 'Muscle tissue'}, {'cui': 'C0231940', 'cui_str': 'Alveolar ventilation (V)'}, {'cui': 'C0019010', 'cui_str': 'Hemodynamics'}, {'cui': 'C0518015', 'cui_str': 'Haemoglobin'}, {'cui': 'C1258192', 'cui_str': 'Systemic vascular resistance'}, {'cui': 'C0205250', 'cui_str': 'High'}, {'cui': 'C0428646', 'cui_str': 'Oxygen concentration'}, {'cui': 'C0179574', 'cui_str': 'Nasal Cannulae'}, {'cui': 'C0392756', 'cui_str': 'Reduced'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0057437', 'cui_str': 'Deoxyhemoglobin'}, {'cui': 'C0441889', 'cui_str': 'Levels'}, {'cui': 'C0024117', 'cui_str': 'Chronic obstructive lung disease'}, {'cui': 'C4758616', 'cui_str': 'Assessment score'}, {'cui': 'C0428776', 'cui_str': 'Cardiac index'}, {'cui': 'C0038455', 'cui_str': 'Stroke volume'}, {'cui': 'C0449438', 'cui_str': 'Status'}, {'cui': 'C0025962', 'cui_str': 'Microcirculation'}]",32.0,0.133534,The systemic vascular resistance (SVR) of the NC group was significantly lower in the seventh session than in the first session (891±287  vs .,"[{'ForeName': 'Tien-Pei', 'Initials': 'TP', 'LastName': 'Fang', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Therapy, Chiayi Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi.'}, {'ForeName': 'Yen-Huey', 'Initials': 'YH', 'LastName': 'Chen', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Therapy, Chang Gung Technical University, Chiayi.'}, {'ForeName': 'Hsiu-Feng', 'Initials': 'HF', 'LastName': 'Hsiao', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Therapy, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Hsiu-Ying', 'Initials': 'HY', 'LastName': 'Cho', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Therapy, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Ying-Huang', 'Initials': 'YH', 'LastName': 'Tsai', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Therapy, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Chung-Chi', 'Initials': 'CC', 'LastName': 'Huang', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Therapy, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Meng-Jer', 'Initials': 'MJ', 'LastName': 'Hsieh', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Therapy, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Huang-Pin', 'Initials': 'HP', 'LastName': 'Wu', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung.'}, {'ForeName': 'Hui-Ling', 'Initials': 'HL', 'LastName': 'Lin', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Therapy, Chiayi Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi.'}]",Annals of translational medicine,['10.21037/atm.2020.03.87']
482,32355744,Prophylactic noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in the weaning of difficult-weaning tracheotomy patients.,"Background


Prophylactic noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) reduces reintubation in endotracheal intubation patients. However, the efficacy of using the prophylactic NPPV in the weaning of tracheotomy patients is unclear.
Methods


We performed prophylactic NPPV in 11 tracheotomy patients who passed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), removed the tracheotomy tube, and closed the incision (intervention group). We matched another 11 tracheotomy patients who also passed an SBT but weaning and removing of tracheotomy tube were managed as conventional methods (control group).
Results


Patients in the control group had reinstitution of mechanical ventilation 36 times after the initial SBT success. Compared with the control group, the interventional group had fewer weaning days (3.0±2.1  vs.  11.3±9.2, P=0.01) from initial SBT success to successful weaning and shorter intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (11.6±4.2  vs.  20.3±11.6, P=0.03) after initial SBT success. The interventional group had lower nosocomial pneumonia rates after initial SBT success (0/11  vs.  2/11), lower ICU mortality (0/11  vs.  2/11), lower hospital mortality (0/11  vs.  3/11), and higher successful weaning rate (11/11  vs.  8/11), but it didn't reach significant difference. Also, there was no significant difference between groups in total duration of ventilation (25.5±13.3  vs.  34.7±24.2 days), hospital stay after initial SBT success (24.0±22.3  vs.  37.4±31.3 days), total ICU stay (35.7±15.3  vs.  45.0±29.5 days), and total hospital stay (48.7±33.1  vs.  68.6±52.6 days).

483,32378422,Effect of nocturnal melatonin intake on cellular damage and recovery from repeated sprint performance during an intensive training schedule.,"An optimal recovery between training sessions is of similar if not greater importance as the training content and program of the training, itself. One of the most used strategies for improving recovery is the ingestion of supplements. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of 5 mg oral melatonin supplementation on the recovery from repeated sprint (RSA) of performance and biochemical responses ( i.e . oxidative stress, leukocytosis cellular damage) after an intensive training camp (TC). Twenty soccer players performed an RSA test before and after an intensive six-day TC associated with nocturnal melatonin (n = 10) or placebo (n = 10) ingestion. Resting and post-RSA test blood samples were obtained before and after the TC. Compared to placebo, melatonin intake decreased resting oxidative stress markers ( i.e , advanced oxidation protein products), leukocytosis ( i.e . white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils (NE)) and biomarkers of cellular damage ( i.e . creatine kinase (CK)). It also lowered post-exercise leukocytosis ( i.e . WBC, NE, lymphocytes (LY), monocytes (MO)) and biomarkers of cellular damage ( i.e . CK, aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT)) and raised the activity of the main antioxidant enzymes ( i.e . glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR)).

484,32355791,γ-aminobutyric acid and glutamate/glutamine alterations of the left prefrontal cortex in individuals with methamphetamine use disorder: a combined transcranial magnetic stimulation-magnetic resonance spectroscopy study.,"Background


GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems are critical in the pathophysiology of addiction and represent potential targets for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). This study aims to investigate changes in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels, the combined resonance of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and cognitive function of patients with methamphetamine dependence following rTMS intervention, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1 H MRS).
Methods


Fifty methamphetamine-dependent patients were randomized to a 4-week course of active or sham rTMS, with  1 H MRS measurement of DLPFC GABA and Glx levels relative to n-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and craving and cognitive function measured at baseline and post-intervention.
Results

485,32355836,Rationale and design of a prospective multi-center randomized trial of EARLY treatment by rivaroxaban versus warfarin in ST-segment elevation MYOcardial infarction with Left Ventricular Thrombus (EARLY-MYO-LVT trial).,"Background


Left ventricular thrombus (LVT), a common complication of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), is associated with increased risk of systemic embolism and high mortality. Current STEMI guidelines recommend adding anticoagulant therapy to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) if early-formulated LVT were detected, for which vitamin K antagonist (VKA) is the standard anticoagulant agent. The role of non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in this scenario is uncertain.
Methods


The EARLY-MYO-LVT study will be a prospective, multi-center and randomized trial designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban versus warfarin in the treatment of post-STEMI LVT. It will enroll 280 patients with STEMI who have developed LVT within the first month of symptom onset. They will be randomized at 1:1 ratio into the group of rivaroxaban 15 mg daily or VKA treatment (with targeted INR 2-2.5) on the basis of standard DAPT (100 mg daily aspirin plus 75 mg daily clopidogrel) for 3-6 months. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the probability of LVT resolution after 3-month triple therapy, and the principal safety outcome will be the incidence of major bleeding events during the treatment.
Discussion


The described study will systemically assess the efficacy and safety of NOACs-based anticoagulant therapy in the treatment of LVT subsequent to STEMI.

486,32355879,Comparison of patterns of laxative ingestion to improve bowel preparation for colonoscopy: a pilot randomized clinical trial.,"Background and study aims   Negative experiences with bowel preparation are a barrier to uptake of colonoscopy. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of different flavoring of polyethylene glycol (PEG) laxatives on patient satisfaction with and adequacy of bowel preparation during colonoscopy.  Patients and methods   This was a single-blind (endoscopist), parallel design, randomized trial (NCT02062112) during which patients scheduled for colonoscopy were assigned to one of three groups: Group 1 (no laxative flavoring, n = 84); Group 2 (flavored entire laxative, n = 90) and Group 3 (tasted PEG with and without flavoring and decided how they want to drink the rest of the laxatives (choice group), n = 82). Patients rated their bowel preparation experience (satisfaction) and endoscopists accessed adequacy of bowel preparation during colonoscopy.  Results   There were no differences in patient ratings across the groups (1, 2 and 3) in taste of the laxatives (  P   = 0.67), ease of drinking (  P   = 0.53), and overall experience of bowel preparation process (  P   = 0.18). However, higher percentage of patients in the choice group would want the same laxative again if they were going to have a repeat colonoscopy in the future (72.5 % vs 81.3 % vs 88.9 %,  P   = 0.04). Surprisingly, adequacy of bowel preparation was highest among patients who drank their PEG unflavored (89.3 % vs 80 % vs 75.5 %,  P   = 0.07) and the had highest rates of adenoma detection (40.5 % vs 23.3 vs 39.0,  P   = 0.03).

487,32355881,High-quality colon cleansing and multiple neoplasia detection with 1L NER1006 versus mid-volume options: Post hoc analysis of phase 3 clinical trials.,"Background and study aims   Multiple neoplasia increase the risk of colorectal cancer. High-quality cleansing may improve adenoma detection. We assessed whether a new bowel preparation can improve colon cleansing and multiple lesion detection.  Patients and methods   This post hoc analysis of two randomized clinical trials in Europe and the US assessed the per study and combined cleansing efficacy of overnight split dosing with (preparation + clear fluids) 1 + 1 L polyethylene glycol (PEG) NER1006 versus 2 + 1 L PEG + ascorbate (2LPEG) or 1 + 2 L oral sulfate solution (OSS) combined. Treatment-blinded central readers assessed cleansing quality using the Harefield Cleansing Scale (HCS). Patients with full segmental scoring were included. HCS segmental scores 0-4 (high-quality = HCS 3-4) were analyzed for NER1006 versus 2LPEG/OSS. Mean number of polyps or adenomas per patient (MPP/MAP) was calculated for treatments in patients with at least one polyp or adenoma.  Results   In 1037 patients, NER1006 attained a greater rate of HCS 3 scores (29 % vs. 20 %;  P   < 0.001) and HCS 4 scores (20 % vs. 17 %;  P   = 0.007) versus 2LPEG/OSS. More polyps (678 versus 585) and adenomas (397 versus 331) were detected with NER1006 (N = 517) versus 2LPEG/OSS (N = 520). In all neoplasia-positive patients, with increasing minimal per-patient neoplasia multiplicity from 1 to 10, NER1006 numerically improved MPP (difference ± SE: 0.48 ± 0.24 to 3.89 ± 3.37) and MAP (0.47 ± 0.26 to 7.50 ± 9.00) versus 2LPEG/OSS.  Conclusions   Low-volume NER1006 enhances high-quality cleansing versus medium-volume 2LPEG or OSS, individually and when combined.

488,32355891,The Role of Parental Knowledge and Attitudes about ADHD and Perceptions of Treatment Response in the Treatment Utilization of Families of Children with ADHD.,"The present study examined the impact of parental knowledge and attitudes about attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and parental perceptions of treatment response on the utilization of behavioral and pharmacological ADHD treatments, using data from a longitudinal treatment study designed to assess physical growth in children with ADHD. It also explored if these relations were moderated by race/ethnicity. Participants include 230 (74% Hispanic) families of treatment naïve children with ADHD ( M  age = 7.56,  SD  = 1.94; 73% male). Families were randomly assigned to receive behavior therapy (BT) or stimulant medication (MED; which also included low dose BT). After 6 months, families whose children still showed at least moderate impairment had access to either treatment for a total of 30 months. Utilization was measured using the number of BT sessions attended and total mg of MED taken over the study period. Families who reported more willingness to use medication for their child's ADHD at baseline were more likely to use MED and less likely to use BT, regardless of race/ethnicity. Parental knowledge about ADHD was only important in predicting BT utilization for White non-Hispanic families.

489,32355959,Corticospinal-motor neuronal plasticity promotes exercise-mediated recovery in humans with spinal cord injury.,"Rehabilitative exercise in humans with spinal cord injury aims to engage residual neural networks to improve functional recovery. We hypothesized that exercise combined with non-invasive stimulation targeting spinal synapses further promotes functional recovery. Twenty-five individuals with chronic incomplete cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord injury were randomly assigned to 10 sessions of exercise combined with paired corticospinal-motor neuronal stimulation (PCMS) or sham-PCMS. In an additional experiment, we tested the effect of PCMS without exercise in 13 individuals with spinal cord injury with similar characteristics. During PCMS, 180 pairs of stimuli were timed to have corticospinal volleys evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor cortex arrive at corticospinal-motor neuronal synapses of upper- or lower-limb muscles (depending on the injury level), 1-2 ms before antidromic potentials were elicited in motor neurons by electrical stimulation of a peripheral nerve. Participants exercised for 45 min after all protocols. We found that the time to complete subcomponents of the Graded and Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility and Prehension (GRASSP) and the 10-m walk test decreased on average by 20% after all protocols. However, the amplitude of corticospinal responses elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation and the magnitude of maximal voluntary contractions in targeted muscles increased on overage by 40-50% after PCMS combined or not with exercise but not after sham-PCMS combined with exercise. Notably, behavioural and physiological effects were preserved 6 months after the intervention in the group receiving exercise with PCMS but not in the group receiving exercise combined with sham-PCMS, suggesting that the stimulation contributed to preserve exercise gains. Our findings indicate that targeted non-invasive stimulation of spinal synapses might represent an effective strategy to facilitate exercise-mediated recovery in humans with different degrees of paralysis and levels of spinal cord injury.",2020,"Notably, behavioural and physiological effects were preserved 6 months after the intervention in the group receiving exercise with PCMS but not in the group receiving exercise combined with sham-PCMS, suggesting that the stimulation contributed to preserve exercise gains.","['humans with spinal cord injury', '13 individuals with spinal cord injury with similar characteristics', 'Twenty-five individuals with chronic incomplete cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spinal cord injury']","['PCMS without exercise', 'exercise combined with paired corticospinal-motor neuronal stimulation (PCMS) or sham-PCMS', 'Corticospinal-motor neuronal plasticity promotes exercise', 'Rehabilitative exercise', 'exercise combined with sham-PCMS']","['time to complete subcomponents of the Graded and Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility and Prehension (GRASSP) and the 10-m walk test', 'behavioural and physiological effects']","[{'cui': 'C0086418', 'cui_str': 'Homo sapiens'}, {'cui': 'C0037929', 'cui_str': 'Spinal cord injury'}, {'cui': 'C0027361', 'cui_str': 'Person'}, {'cui': 'C3715062', 'cui_str': '25'}, {'cui': 'C0205191', 'cui_str': 'Chronic'}, {'cui': 'C0205257', 'cui_str': 'Incomplete'}, {'cui': 'C0027530', 'cui_str': 'Neck structure'}, {'cui': 'C0729233', 'cui_str': 'Dissecting aortic aneurysm, thoracic'}, {'cui': 'C0457848', 'cui_str': 'Segment of lumbar spinal cord'}, {'cui': 'C0005604', 'cui_str': 'Birth trauma'}]","[{'cui': 'C0907533', 'cui_str': 'NOS1 protein, human'}, {'cui': 'C1292856', 'cui_str': 'Stimulation'}, {'cui': 'C0015259', 'cui_str': 'Exercise'}, {'cui': 'C0205195', 'cui_str': 'Combined'}, {'cui': 'C0073980', 'cui_str': 'salicylhydroxamic acid'}, {'cui': 'C0027880', 'cui_str': 'Plasticity, Neuronal'}, {'cui': 'C0033414', 'cui_str': 'Promotion'}, {'cui': 'C0034991', 'cui_str': 'Rehabilitation therapy'}]","[{'cui': 'C0040223', 'cui_str': 'Time'}, {'cui': 'C0205197', 'cui_str': 'Complete'}, {'cui': 'C0441800', 'cui_str': 'Grade'}, {'cui': 'C0031809', 'cui_str': 'Physical examination'}, {'cui': 'C0439823', 'cui_str': 'Sensibilities'}, {'cui': 'C4277740', 'cui_str': 'Walk Test'}, {'cui': 'C0205463', 'cui_str': 'Physiologic'}, {'cui': 'C1280500', 'cui_str': 'Effect'}]",,0.223458,"Notably, behavioural and physiological effects were preserved 6 months after the intervention in the group receiving exercise with PCMS but not in the group receiving exercise combined with sham-PCMS, suggesting that the stimulation contributed to preserve exercise gains.","[{'ForeName': 'Hang Jin', 'Initials': 'HJ', 'LastName': 'Jo', 'Affiliation': 'University of Miami, Department of Neurological Surgery, The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, and Bruce W.

As relapses are frequent on discontinuation, a minimum effective dose of TXA that can be used safely for long time remains unknown. We compared the efficacy of oral TXA 250 mg once daily and 500 mg twice daily given for 16 weeks in 132 (m:f 23:109) adults with melasma. 42 patients in Group-A (TXA 250 mg/d) and 46 patients in Group-B (TXA 500 mg twice/d) completed the study. They were followed up at 4-week interval for percentage reduction in baseline Melasma Area Severity Index (MASI) and at 24 and 28 weeks for relapse. Therapeutic response, for both as per-protocol and intention-to-treat analysis, was scored as very good (> 75% reduction), good (51-75% reduction), moderate (25-50% reduction), mild (< 25% reduction) or no improvement. Reduction in mean MASI score at 4 weeks was not statistically significant in Group-A but it decreased significantly 8 weeks onwards and was comparable with that in Group-B. The relapse rate was higher in Group-B (10.8%) than Group-A (4.7%) at the end of 28 weeks. Oligomenorrhoea and abdominal discomfort in few patients did not necessitate treatment discontinuation.

491,32356023,"The effect of caffeine on cognitive performance is influenced by CYP1A2 but not ADORA2A genotype, yet neither genotype affects exercise performance in healthy adults.","PURPOSE


To determine the influence of two commonly occurring genetic polymorphisms on exercise, cognitive performance, and caffeine metabolism, after caffeine ingestion.
METHODS


Eighteen adults received caffeine or placebo (3 mg kg -1 ) in a randomised crossover study, with measures of endurance exercise (15-min cycling time trial; 70-min post-supplementation) and cognitive performance (psychomotor vigilance test; PVT; pre, 50 and 95-min post-supplementation). Serum caffeine and paraxanthine were measured (pre, 30 and 120-min post-supplementation), and polymorphisms in ADORA2A (rs5751876) and CYP1A2 (rs762551) genes analysed.
RESULTS


Caffeine enhanced exercise performance (P < 0.001), but effects were not different between participants with ADORA2A 'high' (n = 11) vs. 'low' (n = 7) sensitivity genotype (+ 6.4 ± 5.8 vs. + 8.2 ± 6.8%), or CYP1A2 'fast' (n = 10) vs. 'slow' (n = 8) metabolism genotype (+ 7.2 ± 5.9 vs. + 7.0 ± 6.7%, P > 0.05). Caffeine enhanced PVT performance (P < 0.01). The effect of caffeine was greater for CYP1A2 'fast' vs. 'slow' metabolisers for reaction time during exercise (- 18 ± 9 vs. - 1.0 ± 11 ms); fastest 10% reaction time at rest (- 18 ± 11 vs. - 3 ± 15 ms) and lapses at rest (- 3.8 ± 2.7 vs. + 0.4 ± 0.9) (P < 0.05). There were no PVT differences between ADORA2A genotypes (P > 0.05). Serum caffeine and paraxanthine responses were not different between genotypes (P > 0.05).

494,32356211,Antibacterial activity of fluoride varnishes containing different agents in children with severe early childhood caries: a randomised controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVES


The aim of this study was to compare the antibacterial activity of fluoride varnishes containing different agents in children with severe early childhood caries (S-ECC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS


The study was conducted in 92 children with S-ECC. Patients who completed dental treatment under general anaesthesia were included in the study. Patients were divided randomly into four groups: 5% sodium fluoride (SF) control group (n = 23), 5% SF with tricalcium phosphate (TCP) (n = 23), 5% SF with xylitol-coated calcium and phosphate (CXP) (n = 23) and 5% SF with casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) (n = 23). Saliva mutans streptococci (MS) and lactobacilli (LB) levels were evaluated by taking saliva samples at baseline (T 0 ), 1 month (T 1 ) and 3 months (T 2 ) after treatment.
RESULTS


All groups showed a significant decrease in MS and LB levels at T 1  (P < 0.05) except the CXP group. Only the TCP group exhibited significantly decrease MS and LB levels indicating less than 10 5  CFU at both T 1  and T 2  compared with the other groups (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION


Fluoride varnish with TCP provided significantly more reduction in MS and LB levels than other fluoride varnishes.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE


Fluoride varnish with TCP had a significant antibacterial effect against cariogenic bacteria until the end of the third month. Long lasting antibacterial effect provides additional advantage for reducing bacteria levels in children.

495,32356212,Diode laser surgery versus electrocautery in the treatment of inflammatory fibrous hyperplasia: a randomized double-blind clinical trial.,"OBJECTIVES


To compare the efficacy and safety of diode laser and electrocautery techniques for inflammatory fibrous hyperplasia (IFH) removal.
MATERIALS AND METHODS


In this randomized double-blind clinical trial, 40 individuals were randomly allocated to two groups: group 1 (G1) consisted of 20 individuals assigned to treatment with diode laser and group 2 (G2) consisted of 20 individuals assigned to treatment with electrocautery. The following transoperative parameters were evaluated: bleeding, temperature, and surgical technique parameters (energy deposited on tissue, flow rate, and time of incision). The postoperative parameters evaluated were as follows: pain, functional alterations (chewing, speaking), analgesic medication intake, swelling, healing of the wound area, and patient satisfaction.
RESULTS


Among the 40 individuals included in the study, four (two in G1 and two in G2) did not complete the entire follow-up. Therefore, 36 individuals (18 in G1 and 18 in G2) participated. Participants in G1 and in G2 had similar demographic characteristics. No difference regarding the trans- or postoperative parameters evaluated was observed between G1 and G2 (p > 0.05). Also, no difference regarding the time for healing was observed between groups.
CONCLUSIONS


Diode laser seems to be as effective and safe as electrocautery when applied under similar conditions for IFH removal.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE


IFH corresponds to 65% of the lesions observed in denture wearers. This study shows that under similar conditions diode laser is as effective and safe as electrocautery for removal of IFH.",2020,"CONCLUSIONS


Diode laser seems to be as effective and safe as electrocautery when applied under similar conditions for IFH removal.

496,32356244,Ranibizumab Pretreatment in Vitrectomy with Internal Limiting Membrane Peeling on Diabetic Macular Edema in Severe Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy.,"AIM


To evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) pretreatment for pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling in severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) combined with macular edema (ME).
METHODS


Sixty-three patients with ME and PDR were divided into IVR and control groups. Three days before PPV stripping, ranibizumab was injected into the patients in the IVR group. The patients were followed for 6 months. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), visual acuity improvement, centre macular thickness (CMT), and intraoperative and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS


The BCVA of the IVR group was significantly improved at 1, 3 and 6 months compared with the preoperative BCVA (P < 0.01). The BCVA of the control group was significantly improved at 3 and 6 months compared with the preoperative BCVA (P < 0.01), but was not significantly improved at 1 month. At 1 and 3 months, the BCVA of the IVR group was significantly better than that of the control group after surgery, with no difference between the two groups at 6 months. The CMT of the IVR group was thinner than that of the control group at 1 and 3 months (P < 0.01), with no significant difference at 6 months after surgery. The surgical time, the risk of intraoperative bleeding, the incidence of iatrogenic retinal breaks, the frequency of endodiathermy and the rate of silicone oil tamponade were significantly different between the two groups (all P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of postoperative complications.

497,32356332,Gait training for adults with cerebral palsy following harmonic modification in rhythmic auditory stimulation.,"This study aimed to investigate the differences in gait outcomes of young adults with cerebral palsy (CP) following rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) with different types of cueing. A total of 13 ambulatory adults with CP were recruited. The participants were assigned to receive either RAS with simple chords or RAS with complex chords. Each participant received 30-min individual sessions three times per week for 4 weeks. In the simple RAS group, basic chords were used for cueing. In the complex RAS group, the diversified chords were adopted from patients' preferred music. At pre- and posttest, spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters and the range of motion (ROM) for each joint during a gait cycle were collected. After RAS, cadence, velocity, and stride length significantly increased, but no significant group effect was found. Meanwhile, regarding kinematic parameters, a significant interaction effect between time and group was observed with the angle of plantar flexion in the preswing phase and ROM in the ankle. The complex RAS group showed increased maximal ankle plantar flexion in the preswing phase. These results demonstrated that the primary agent for gait control is rhythm, while perception of music facilitates patient engagement in walking differently depending on the level of musical elements.",2020,"After RAS, cadence, velocity, and stride length significantly increased, but no significant group effect was found.","['young adults with cerebral palsy (CP', '13 ambulatory adults with CP were recruited', 'adults with cerebral palsy following harmonic modification in rhythmic auditory stimulation']","['Gait training', 'RAS with simple chords or RAS with complex chords', 'rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS']","['cadence, velocity, and stride length', 'maximal ankle plantar flexion', 'spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters and the range of motion (ROM', 'angle of plantar flexion', 'gait outcomes']","[{'cui': 'C0238598', 'cui_str': 'Young Adult'}, {'cui': 'C0007789', 'cui_str': 'Cerebral palsy'}, {'cui': 'C0002424', 'cui_str': 'Ambulatory care site'}, {'cui': 'C0001675', 'cui_str': 'Adult'}, {'cui': 'C0231290', 'cui_str': 'Status post'}, {'cui': 'C0392747', 'cui_str': 'Changing'}, {'cui': 'C0001164', 'cui_str': 'Stimulation, Acoustic'}]","[{'cui': 'C0085673', 'cui_str': 'Gait training procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0001164', 'cui_str': 'Stimulation, Acoustic'}, {'cui': 'C0205352', 'cui_str': 'Simple'}, {'cui': 'C0056210', 'cui_str': 'complex V (mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system)'}]","[{'cui': 'C0439830', 'cui_str': 'Velocity'}, {'cui': 'C1444754', 'cui_str': 'Length'}, {'cui': 'C0205289', 'cui_str': 'Maximal'}, {'cui': 'C0003086', 'cui_str': 'Tarsus'}, {'cui': 'C0231784', 'cui_str': 'Plantar flexion'}, {'cui': 'C0600169', 'cui_str': 'Kinematics'}, {'cui': 'C0449381', 'cui_str': 'Observation parameter'}, {'cui': 'C0080078', 'cui_str': 'Range of joint movement'}, {'cui': 'C0948106', 'cui_str': 'Amniorrhexis'}, {'cui': 'C0205143', 'cui_str': 'Angular'}, {'cui': 'C0016928', 'cui_str': 'Gait'}, {'cui': 'C1274040', 'cui_str': 'Result'}]",13.0,0.0365965,"After RAS, cadence, velocity, and stride length significantly increased, but no significant group effect was found.","[{'ForeName': 'Soo Ji', 'Initials': 'SJ', 'LastName': 'Kim', 'Affiliation': 'Music Therapy Education, Graduate School of Education, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'ForeName': 'Ga Eul', 'Initials': 'GE', 'LastName': 'Yoo', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Music Therapy, Graduate School, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'ForeName': 'Yoon-Kyum', 'Initials': 'YK', 'LastName': 'Shin', 'Affiliation': 'Department and Research Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'ForeName': 'Sung-Rae', 'Initials': 'SR', 'LastName': 'Cho', 'Affiliation': 'Department and Research Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.'}]",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,['10.1111/nyas.14306']

The present study was conducted to compare the effectiveness in removals of protein-bound (indoxyl sulfate, IS), middle-molecule [beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) and alpha-1 microglobulin (A1MG)], and small-molecule uremic toxins between super high-flux HD (SHF-HD), HD with a novel SHF dialyzer and high-volume post-dilution ol-HDF in a non-inferiority fashion. Fifteen prevalent HD patients were randomly allocated into 2 sequences of 12-week treatment periods of SHF-HD treatment and later high-volume post-dilution ol-HDF period or vice versa. Each treatment period was divided by a wash out phase of 4-week high-flux HD. Twelve of fifteen patients could complete the study. When compared with high-volume post-dilution ol-HDF (convective volume of 24.4 ± 3.52 L), SHF-HD provided comparable RR values of IS, B2M, and A1MG with mean difference of 5.87 (95% CI,-1.63,13.37), 1.98 (95% CI,-0.21,4.18), and 22.96 (95%CI,-1.91,47.83), respectively. The spKt/Vurea was not different. The pre-dialysis levels of all uremic toxins at baseline and after 12-week treatment did not differ between both groups. Although albumin loss in dialysate in SHF-HD was greater than high-volume post-dilution ol-HDF, the serum albumin levels after 12-week SHF-HD treatment were significantly higher than baseline. In conclusion, SHF-HD provides non-inferior effectiveness to high-volume post-dilution ol-HDF in removing various uremic toxins with significantly increased serum albumin levels despite higher albumin loss. SHF-HD might be an effectively alternative treatment when high-volume post-dilution ol-HDF is not available.",2020,The pre-dialysis levels of all uremic toxins at baseline and after 12-week treatment did not differ between both groups.,"['Fifteen prevalent HD patients', 'Middle-molecule Uremic Toxins']","['protein-bound (indoxyl sulfate, IS), middle-molecule [beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) and alpha-1 microglobulin (A1MG', 'SHF-HD treatment and later high-volume post-dilution ol-HDF period or vice versa', 'High-Volume Post-dilution Online Hemodiafiltration']","['pre-dialysis levels of all uremic toxins', 'serum albumin levels']","[{'cui': 'C0019004', 'cui_str': 'Hemodialysis'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0227972', 'cui_str': 'Structure of median lobe of prostate'}, {'cui': 'C0567416', 'cui_str': 'Molecule'}, {'cui': 'C0040549', 'cui_str': 'Toxin'}]","[{'cui': 'C0033618', 'cui_str': 'Protein binding'}, {'cui': 'C0021210', 'cui_str': 'Indican'}, {'cui': 'C0227972', 'cui_str': 'Structure of median lobe of prostate'}, {'cui': 'C0567416', 'cui_str': 'Molecule'}, {'cui': 'C0005149', 'cui_str': 'Beta 2 microglobulin'}, {'cui': 'C0051266', 'cui_str': 'Alpha 1 microglobulin'}, {'cui': 'C0019004', 'cui_str': 'Hemodialysis'}, {'cui': 'C0039798', 'cui_str': 'therapy'}, {'cui': 'C0205087', 'cui_str': 'Late'}, {'cui': 'C0205250', 'cui_str': 'High'}, {'cui': 'C0449468', 'cui_str': 'Volume'}, {'cui': 'C0445431', 'cui_str': 'After the filter'}, {'cui': 'C0206075', 'cui_str': 'Hemodiafiltration'}]","[{'cui': 'C1264634', 'cui_str': 'Pre-dialysis'}, {'cui': 'C0441889', 'cui_str': 'Levels'}, {'cui': 'C0040549', 'cui_str': 'Toxin'}, {'cui': 'C0523465', 'cui_str': 'Albumin measurement, serum'}]",15.0,0.0143314,The pre-dialysis levels of all uremic toxins at baseline and after 12-week treatment did not differ between both groups.,"[{'ForeName': 'Theerachai', 'Initials': 'T', 'LastName': 'Thammathiwat', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai Red Cross Society and Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Khajohn', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Tiranathanagul', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai Red Cross Society and Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Maneerut', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Limjariyakul', 'Affiliation': 'Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacogenomics Research Unit, Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Pajaree', 'Initials': 'P', 'LastName': 'Chariyavilaskul', 'Affiliation': 'Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacogenomics Research Unit, Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kullaya', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Takkavatakarn', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai Red Cross Society and Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Paweena', 'Initials': 'P', 'LastName': 'Susantitaphong', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai Red Cross Society and Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Srichan', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Meesangnin', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai Red Cross Society and Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Supeecha', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Wittayalertpanya', 'Affiliation': 'Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacogenomics Research Unit, Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kearkiat', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Praditpornsilpa', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai Red Cross Society and Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'ForeName': 'Somchai', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Eiam-Ong', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai Red Cross Society and Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}]","Therapeutic apheresis and dialysis : official peer-reviewed journal of the International Society for Apheresis, the Japanese Society for Apheresis, the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy",['10.1111/1744-9987.13508']

To evaluate fasting for 12-hours compared to expedited oral feeding in hospitalised hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) DESIGN: Randomised trial SETTING: University Hospital, Malaysia: April 2016-April 2017 POPULATION: 160 women hospitalised for hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) METHOD: Women were randomised upon admission to fasting for 12-hours or expedited oral feeding. Standard HG care was instituted.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE


Primary outcome was satisfaction score with overall treatment at 24 hours (0-10 Visual Numerical Rating Scale VNRS), vomiting episodes within 24 hours and nausea VNRS score at enrollment, 8, 16 and 24 hours.
RESULTS


Satisfaction score, median [interquartile range] 8 [5-9] vs. 8 [7-9] P=0.08 and 24-hour vomiting episodes were 1[0-4] vs. 1[0-5] P = 0.24 for 12-hours fasting vs. expedited feeding respectively. Repeated measures analysis of variance of nausea scores over 24-hours showed no difference (P=0.11) between trial arms. Participants randomised to 12-hours fasting compared to expedited feeding were less likely to prefer their feeding regimen in future hospitalisation 41% vs 65% P=0.001, to recommend to a friend 65% vs 84% P=0.01 (RR 0.8 95% CI 0.6-0.9) and to adhere to protocol 85% vs 95% P=0.04 (RR 0.9 95% CI 0.8-1.0). Symptoms profile, ketonuria status at 24 hours and length of hospital stay were not different.

500,32356505,The effects of calf massage in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a prospective interventional study.,"Purpose:  We explored the effects of standardized calf massage in ambulant boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) using a prospective study design. Materials and Methods:  Twenty boys completed two study visits, 1 week apart. At both visits, each leg received a 10-min calf massage (intervention) and a 10-min control rest period (placebo) in randomized order. Muscle length of calf and hamstrings and gastrocnemius stiffness were measured by a blinded assessor before and after intervention and placebo. Measures of gait function (timed 10-m walk/run and spatio-temporal gait parameters); gastrocnemius muscle ultrasound findings; participant perception of leg pain, stiffness and effort of walking and general psychological well-being were also collected. Results:  Consistent significant small increases in muscle length of soleus, gastrocnemius and hamstrings were recorded post-massage, and gastrocnemius stiffness decreased. Small changes in gastrocnemius and soleus length only were also recorded following the control rest period. Gait function and general well-being remained stable throughout. Measurement across both study visits suggested that gains in muscle length may be cumulative with repeated massage. Conclusions:  Calf massage is safe and associated with benefits to muscle length and stiffness for ambulant boys with DMD.Implications for RehabilitationIn a small sample of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, calf massage was found to be safe, well-tolerated and associated with increased muscle length and decreased stiffness.The use of massage may assist in managing muscle length in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",2020,"Consistent significant small increases in muscle length of soleus, gastrocnemius and hamstrings were recorded post-massage, and gastrocnemius stiffness decreased.","['boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Twenty boys completed two study visits, 1 week apart', 'ambulant boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD']","['calf massage', 'Calf massage', 'standardized calf massage', '10-min calf massage (intervention) and a 10-min control rest period (placebo', 'placebo']","['gait function (timed 10-m walk/run and spatio-temporal gait parameters); gastrocnemius muscle ultrasound findings; participant perception of leg pain, stiffness and effort of walking and general psychological well-being', 'Gait function', 'gastrocnemius and soleus length', 'Muscle length of calf and hamstrings and gastrocnemius stiffness', 'muscle length of soleus, gastrocnemius and hamstrings']","[{'cui': 'C0870221', 'cui_str': 'Male child'}, {'cui': 'C0013264', 'cui_str': 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy'}, {'cui': 'C0205197', 'cui_str': 'Complete'}, {'cui': 'C0008972', 'cui_str': 'Clinical Study'}, {'cui': 'C1442452', 'cui_str': 'One week'}]","[{'cui': 'C0230445', 'cui_str': 'Structure of calf of leg'}, {'cui': 'C0024875', 'cui_str': 'Massage'}, {'cui': 'C0439232', 'cui_str': 'min'}, {'cui': 'C0052080', 'cui_str': 'antineoplaston A10'}, {'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}, {'cui': 'C0035253', 'cui_str': 'Rest'}, {'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}]","[{'cui': 'C0016928', 'cui_str': 'Gait'}, {'cui': 'C0031843', 'cui_str': 'PH'}, {'cui': 'C0040223', 'cui_str': 'Time'}, {'cui': 'C0080331', 'cui_str': 'Walking'}, {'cui': 'C0011991', 'cui_str': 'Diarrhea'}, {'cui': 'C0442043', 'cui_str': 'Temporal'}, {'cui': 'C0449381', 'cui_str': 'Observation parameter'}, {'cui': 'C0242691', 'cui_str': 'Gastrocnemius muscle structure'}, {'cui': 'C1299966', 'cui_str': 'Ultrasound scan finding'}, {'cui': 'C0030971', 'cui_str': 'Perception'}, {'cui': 'C0023222', 'cui_str': 'Pain in lower limb'}, {'cui': 'C0427008', 'cui_str': 'Stiffness'}, {'cui': 'C0015264', 'cui_str': 'Exertion'}, {'cui': 'C0205246', 'cui_str': 'Generalized'}, {'cui': 'C0424578', 'cui_str': 'Well in self'}, {'cui': 'C0242694', 'cui_str': 'Soleus muscle structure'}, {'cui': 'C1444754', 'cui_str': 'Length'}, {'cui': 'C0026845', 'cui_str': 'Muscle tissue'}, {'cui': 'C0230445', 'cui_str': 'Structure of calf of leg'}, {'cui': 'C0584895', 'cui_str': 'Posterior muscle of thigh structure'}]",20.0,0.0284123,"Consistent significant small increases in muscle length of soleus, gastrocnemius and hamstrings were recorded post-massage, and gastrocnemius stiffness decreased.","[{'ForeName': 'Kate', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Carroll', 'Affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.""}, {'ForeName': 'Eppie M', 'Initials': 'EM', 'LastName': 'Yiu', 'Affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.""}, {'ForeName': 'Monique M', 'Initials': 'MM', 'LastName': 'Ryan', 'Affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.""}, {'ForeName': 'Rachel A', 'Initials': 'RA', 'LastName': 'Kennedy', 'Affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.""}, {'ForeName': 'Katy', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'de Valle', 'Affiliation': ""Department of Neurology, The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.""}]",Disability and rehabilitation,['10.1080/09638288.2020.1753829']

To determine the time course and duration of common, early-onset treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) associated with sodium oxybate (SXB) use in adults with narcolepsy.
METHODS


These were post hoc analyses of two 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. In SXB-15, participants (N=246) received daily placebo (n=60) or SXB (n=186), initiated at 4.5 g. Participants assigned to SXB 6 or 9 g were titrated in 1.5-g increments. In SXB-22, participants entering on modafinil (N=231) received placebo (n=56), SXB (n=55), modafinil (n=63), or SXB and modafinil (n=57). SXB was initiated at 6 g for weeks 1-4 and increased to 9 g for weeks 5-8. TEAEs reported more frequently in SXB-treated participants than placebo and in ≥5% of any SXB treatment group during week 1 were examined as TEAEs of interest.
RESULTS


Dizziness and nausea met criteria as TEAEs of interest in both studies; headache also met criteria as a TEAE of interest in SXB-15. Incidence of new or worsened TEAEs was highest at week 1 (SXB-15: dizziness, 7.5%; headache, 7.5%; nausea, 5.9%; SXB-22: dizziness, 5.4%; nausea, 7.1%) and decreased over time in both studies. The longest median duration was reported for dizziness: 9.0 and 17.5 days in SXB-15 and SXB-22, respectively. Dizziness caused discontinuation in 2.2% and 3.6% of participants in SXB-15 and SXB-22, respectively; nausea caused discontinuation in 2.7% and 1.8%.
CONCLUSIONS


Common early-onset TEAEs associated with SXB treatment were generally of short duration, and their incidence decreased over time. These TEAEs accounted for few discontinuations overall.

502,32356559,Physical activity and markers of glycation in older individuals: data from a combined cross-sectional and randomized controlled trial (EXAMIN AGE).,"BACKGROUND


Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are protein modifications that are predominantly formed from dicarbonyl compounds that arise from glucose and lipid metabolism. AGEs and sedentary behavior have been identified as a driver of accelerated (vascular) aging. The effect of physical activity on AGE accumulation is unknown. Therefore, we investigated whether plasma AGEs and dicarbonyl levels are different across older individuals that were active or sedentary and whether plasma AGEs are affected by high-intensity interval training (HIIT).
METHODS


We included healthy older active (HA, n=38, 44.7% female, 60.1 ± 7.7 years old) and healthy older sedentary (HS, n=36, 72.2% female, 60.0 ± 7.3 years old) individuals as well as older sedentary individuals with increased cardiovascular risk (SR, n=84, 50% female, 58.7 ± 6.6 years old). The SR group was randomized into a 12-week walking-based HIIT program or control group. We measured protein-bound and free plasma AGEs and dicarbonyls by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) at baseline and after the HIIT intervention.
RESULTS


Protein-bound AGE Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) was lower in SR (2.6 ± 0.5 μmol/l) and HS (3.1 ± 0.5 μmol/l) than in HA (3.6 ± 0.6 μmol/l; P<0.05) and remained significantly lower after adjustment for several potential confounders. None of the other glycation markers were different between HS and HA. HIIT did not change plasma AGEs and dicarbonyls in SR.
DISCUSSION

503,32350909,Clinical benefit of ixazomib plus lenalidomide-dexamethasone in myeloma patients with non-canonical NF-κB pathway activation.,"OBJECTIVES


Evaluating potential relationships between progression-free survival (PFS) and tumor gene expression patterns and mutational status was an exploratory objective of the phase 3 TOURMALINE-MM1 study (NCT01564537) of ixazomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (IRd) vs placebo-Rd in 722 patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).
METHODS


We utilized gene expression and mutation data from screening bone marrow aspirates to identify tumors with non-canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway activation.
RESULTS


DNA/RNA sequencing data were available for 339 (47.0%)/399 (55.2%) patients; 49/339 (14.5%) patients had non-canonical NF-κB pathway gene mutations (tumor-necrosis-factor receptor-associated factor 2, 3 [TRAF2, TRAF3], baculoviral-inhibitor-of-apoptosis repeat-containing 2/3 [BIRC2/3]), and PFS was significantly longer with IRd vs placebo-Rd in these patients (hazard ratio [HR] 0.23). In patients with lower TRAF3 expression (median not reached vs 11 months, HR 0.47) and higher NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) expression (median not reached vs 14 months, HR 0.45), both associated with non-canonical NF-κB pathway activation, PFS was significantly longer with IRd vs placebo-Rd. TRAF3 expression was decreased in patients harboring t(4;14) and 1q21 amplification, suggesting increased non-canonical NF-κB pathway activation.
CONCLUSIONS


Adding ixazomib to Rd provides clinical benefit in MM tumors with increased non-canonical NF-κB pathway activity.

504,32350915,"Cardiac troponin is associated with cardiac outcomes in men and women with atrial fibrillation, insights from the ARISTOTLE trial.","BACKGROUND


Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and I (cTnI) concentrations provide strong prognostic information in anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Whether the associations between cardiac troponin concentrations and mortality and morbidity differs by sex is not known.
OBJECTIVES


To assess whether men and women have different concentrations and prognostic value of cTnT and cTnI measurements in anticoagulated patients with AF.
METHODS


cTnT and cTnI concentrations were measured with high-sensitivity (hs) assays in EDTA plasma samples obtained from the multicentre ARISTOTLE trial, which randomized patients with AF and at least one risk factor for stroke or systemic embolic event to warfarin or apixaban. Patients were stratified according to sex and the associations between hs-troponin concentrations and all-cause death, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke or systemic embolic event, and major bleeding were assessed in multivariable regression models.
RESULTS


We found higher cardiac troponin concentrations in men (n=9649) compared to women (n=5331), both for hs-cTnT (median 11.8 [Q1-3 8.1-18.0] vs. 9.6 [6.7-14.3] ng/L, p<0.001) and hs-cTnI (5.8 [3.4-10.8] vs. 4.9 [3.1-8.8] ng/L, p<0.001). Adjusting for baseline demographics, comorbidities, and medications, men still had significantly higher hs-troponin concentrations than women. C-reactive protein and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentrations were higher in female patients. Both hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI concentrations were associated with all clinical outcomes similarly in men and women (p value for interaction >0.05 for all endpoints).

505,32350931,Effect of a tailored home-based exercise program in patients with systemic sclerosis: A randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE


The aim was to evaluate the effect of a home-based exercise program on functional capacity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and disability, in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc).
METHODS


A 6-month randomized controlled trial was conducted on SSc patients by comparing a home-based minimally supervised exercise program (exercise on a stationary cycle and strengthening of upper limbs; stretching of the hands) with usual care. At baseline and after 3 and 6 months, the patients underwent: 6 minutes walking test; hand mobility in scleroderma test; maximal exercise test on an ergocycle; strength measures (handgrip, quadriceps, and biceps). HRQoL (short-form 36 [SF-36]) and disability (health assessment questionnaire disability index [HAQ-DI]) were measured at the same time.
RESULTS


Forty-four patients participated in the study. Twenty-two were randomly assigned to the intervention group (IG, mean age 63.60 ± 10.40 years) and 22 to the control group (CG, 61.80 ± 14.40 years). At 6 months, the distance walked in 6 minutes increased by 46 m (baseline 486, 95% CI 458-513 m; 6 months 532, 95% CI 504-561 m) in IG, whereas it decreased by 5 m (baseline 464, 95% CI 431-497 m; 6 months 459, 95% CI 427-490 m) in CG with a significantly different temporal trend at the between-groups comparison (P < .001). An improvement was also observed for strength measures (handgrip, P = .003; quadriceps, P < .001; biceps, P < .001), for the SF-36 physical component score (P < .001) and for the HAQ-DI (P = .011).

506,32350975,"Onabotulinumtoxin Type A reconstitution with preserved versus preservative-free saline in chronic migraine (B-RECON). A randomized, double-blind trial.","INTRODUCTION


Onabotulinumtoxin type A (BoNTA) is manufactured as powder that requires reconstitution with normal saline prior to injection. Previous literature has suggested that preserved saline (PS) exerts a local anesthetic effect, and reduces the procedure discomfort when used in reconstitution in lieu of preservative-free saline (PFS). However, this was mainly studied in the aesthetics indications of BoNTA, and never in its use for the treatment of chronic migraine. The distinction is important as the population of patients with chronic migraine suffers high incidence of scalp allodynia which makes it more prone to injection site pain. In addition, the pain of the procedure itself may be related to the spike of migraine frequency in the immediate post- procedural period which can occur in up to 5% of patients receiving the treatment. Our trial aimed to study the difference in procedural pain scale, and post-procedural headache rating with the use of PS vs PFS in constitution of BoNTA when used as a treatment for chronic migraine.
METHODS


68 subjects were consecutively enrolled in an outpatient setting at a large tertiary headache center over a period of 6 months. Subjects were randomized into PS or PFS group. BoNTA was administered as per standard protocol in both groups. Injection site pain scores and frequency of headache days in the immediate following week were recorded. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare differences in between groups using SPSS software.
RESULTS


Analysis (SAS V 9.4) revealed that those receiving [PF] had significantly higher procedure pain scores than those receiving [P] (5.3 vs 3.2 respectively). There was no difference in the headache or migraine frequency in the immediate post procedural period.
CONCLUSION


This study supports the use of preserved saline (bacteriostatic) over preservative-free saline for reconstitution of BoNTA in chronic migraine as it reduces the discomfort of the injection sites. What's already known about this topic? Onabotulinumtoxin A is an effective treatment for chronic migraine. 2. Both preserved, and preservative-free saline are used interchangeably in clinical practice for Onabotuliniumtoxin A reconstitution. What does this article add? 1.

507,32350999,Evaluation of a novel telemedicine-based intervention to manage body image disturbance in head and neck cancer survivors.,"OBJECTIVES


The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical impact of BRIGHT (Building a Renewed ImaGe after Head & neck cancer Treatment), a novel telemedicine-based cognitive-behavioral intervention to manage body image disturbance (BID) in head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors.
METHODS


Head and neck cancer survivors with BID were enrolled into a single-arm pilot trial. Participants completed study measures at baseline, 1- and 3-months post-BRIGHT to assess its acceptability and clinical impact. Participants completed semi-structured interviews to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of BRIGHT and refine the intervention.
RESULTS


Ten HNC survivors with BID were enrolled into the trial of tablet-based BRIGHT. BRIGHT was feasible, as judged by low dropout (n = 1), high session completion rates (100%; 45/45) and low rates of technical issues with the tablet-based delivery (11% minor; 0% major). Ninety percent of participants were highly likely to recommend BRIGHT, reflecting its acceptability. BRIGHT was associated with a 34.5% reduction in mean Body Image Scale scores at 1-month post-BRIGHT (mean difference from baseline = 4.56; 95% CI 1.55, 7.56), an effect that was durable at 3-months post-BRIGHT (mean decrease from baseline = 3.56; 95% CI 1.15-5.96). Program evaluation revealed high levels of satisfaction with BRIGHT, particularly the delivery platform. During the qualitative evaluation, participants highlighted that BRIGHT improved image-related coping behavior.

508,32351061,[Systemic enzyme therapy for treatment of women with chronic recurrent bacterial cystitis].,"INTRODUCTION


In most cases, treatment of infectious and inflammatory diseases, including lower urinary tract infections, includes antibacterial drugs. However, their efficiency decreases every year. The absence of new groups of antibiotics makes it necessary to develop alternative treatment schemes and methods for improving efficiency of existing drugs. Systemic enzyme therapy is one of the promising directions in the treatment of lower urinary tract infections, which was shown to be effective for treating a number of diseases.
AIM


to evaluate the results of complex treatment of women with chronic recurrent bacterial cystitis using a drug for systemic enzyme therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS


The examination and treatment of 60 women aged 19 to 45 years with an exacerbation of chronic recurrent bacterial cystitis, who were randomly divided into two groups of 30 patients, was performed. In the group 1, patients received standard antibiotic therapy. In the group 2, women additionally received Phlogenzym. An evaluation of the efficiency was carried out on the 1st, 7th and 14th day and included analysis of lower urinary tract symptoms, according to bladder diaries, assessment of pain intensity and laboratory tests (C-reactive protein [CRP], IL-6, IL-1, TNF. During long-term follow-up (6 months after completion of treatment), the relapse rate was evaluated in both groups.
RESULTS


At admission, all women had clinical and laboratory signs of cystitis. By the 14th day, there was normalization of evaluated parameters in both groups. However, in patients receiving systemic enzyme therapy a more rapid relief of the inflammatory process (a decrease in the frequency of urination, urgency, nocturia, severity of inflammatory changes in the blood and urine) by the 7th day of treatment was observed. During a further 6-month follow-up, relapses were detected in 9 (30%) and 4 (13.3%) patients in group 1 and 2, respectively.
CONCLUSION


The results of the study demonstrated the high efficiency of systemic enzyme therapy. Its use for complex treatment provides more rapid relief of lower urinary tract symptoms and pain, as well as reduces the number of relapses in women with chronic recurrent bacterial cystitis.",2020,"By the 14th day, there was normalization of evaluated parameters in both groups.","['60 women aged 19 to 45 years with an exacerbation of chronic recurrent bacterial cystitis', 'women with chronic recurrent bacterial cystitis using a drug for systemic enzyme therapy', 'women with chronic recurrent bacterial cystitis']","['systemic enzyme therapy', 'Systemic enzyme therapy', 'Phlogenzym', 'standard antibiotic therapy']","['frequency of urination, urgency, nocturia, severity of inflammatory changes in the blood and urine', 'clinical and laboratory signs of cystitis', 'rapid relief of the inflammatory process', 'bladder diaries, assessment of pain intensity and laboratory tests (C-reactive protein [CRP], IL-6, IL-1, TNF', 'relapse rate']","[{'cui': 'C0043210', 'cui_str': 'Woman'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0205191', 'cui_str': 'Chronic'}, {'cui': 'C1959870', 'cui_str': 'Recurrent bacterial cystitis'}, {'cui': 'C0013227', 'cui_str': 'Pharmaceutical / biologic product'}, {'cui': 'C2936197', 'cui_str': 'Enzymotherapy'}]","[{'cui': 'C2936197', 'cui_str': 'Enzymotherapy'}, {'cui': 'C0769132', 'cui_str': 'Phlogenzym'}, {'cui': 'C0038137', 'cui_str': 'standards'}, {'cui': 'C0003232', 'cui_str': 'Antibiotic'}]","[{'cui': 'C0042023', 'cui_str': 'Increased frequency of urination'}, {'cui': 'C0439609', 'cui_str': 'Urgent'}, {'cui': 'C0028734', 'cui_str': 'Nocturia'}, {'cui': 'C0439793', 'cui_str': 'Severities'}, {'cui': 'C0392747', 'cui_str': 'Changing'}, {'cui': 'C0005767', 'cui_str': 'Blood'}, {'cui': 'C0042036', 'cui_str': 'Urine'}, {'cui': 'C0205210', 'cui_str': 'Clinical'}, {'cui': 'C0022877', 'cui_str': 'Laboratory'}, {'cui': 'C0220912', 'cui_str': 'signs'}, {'cui': 'C0010692', 'cui_str': 'Cystitis'}, {'cui': 'C0456962', 'cui_str': 'Rapid'}, {'cui': 'C0564405', 'cui_str': 'Feeling relief'}, {'cui': 'C1522240', 'cui_str': 'Process'}, {'cui': 'C0430970', 'cui_str': 'Urinary frequency volume chart'}, {'cui': 'C0031809', 'cui_str': 'Physical examination'}, {'cui': 'C1320357', 'cui_str': 'Pain intensity'}, {'cui': 'C0022885', 'cui_str': 'Laboratory procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0006560', 'cui_str': 'C reactive protein'}, {'cui': 'C0021760', 'cui_str': 'Interleukin-6'}, {'cui': 'C0021755', 'cui_str': 'Interleukin-1'}, {'cui': 'C0041368', 'cui_str': 'TNF Receptor Ligands'}, {'cui': 'C0035020', 'cui_str': 'Relapse phase'}]",60.0,0.01888,"By the 14th day, there was normalization of evaluated parameters in both groups.","[{'ForeName': 'A V', 'Initials': 'AV', 'LastName': ""Kuz'menko"", 'Affiliation': 'Department of Urology of FGBOU VO Voronezh State Medical University named after N.N.

510,32351092,[Application of nerve block in total knee arthroplasty under general anesthesia].,"OBJECTIVE


To evaluate the effect of femoral and sciatic nerve block in total knee replacement of elderly patients under general anesthesia.
METHODS


From July 2017 to July 2019, 60 patients with unilateral total knee replacement were selected, including 35 males and 25 females; aged 66 to 74(70.2±10.3) years;BMI 18 to 25 (21.3 ± 3.5) kg /m 2 ;course 2 to 3 (1.2±0.3) days. The patients were divided into general anesthesia group (G group) 30 cases and general anesthesia plus nerve block group(GNB group) 30 cases. In GNB group, the femoral nerve sciatic nerve block was guided by ultrasound before anesthesia induction, 20 to 25 ml was injected into the femoral nerve puncture point with 0.5% ropivacaine, 15 to 20 ml was injected into the sciaticnerve puncture point, and the total volume was no more than 40 ml. Postoperative intravenous analgesia (PCIA) was performed in two groups. The dosage of propofol and remifentanil was recorded. Forty-eight hours after operation, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and postoperative farsightedness were recorded. When VAS>3, tramadol 2 mg / kg was injected intravenously, and the additional times of tramadol were recorded. Forty-eight hours after operation, patients' satisfaction score was used to record the length of stay.
RESULTS


Compared with group G, the dosage of propofol and remifentanil decreased, the incidence of PONV and the number of additional tramadol decreased, and the patients' satisfaction increased ( P <0.05). There was no significant difference in the length of stay between two groups ( P >0.05). The ROM and HSS scores of two groups after treatment were higher than those before treatment ( P <0.05), and the VAS scores were lower than those before treatment ( P <0.05). There was no significantdifference in ROM, VAS scores and HSS scores between two groups before treatment ( P >0.05). The ROM and HSS scores of the GNB group after treatment were higher than those of the G group ( P <0.05), and the VAS scores were lower than those of the G group ( P <0.05).

511,32351156,The impact of an eye drop booklet on distress in children when receiving eye drops.,"Purpose : Child- and family-centered care is an increasingly important area in healthcare. Up to now, little attention has been paid to the experience of children and their parents in ophthalmological healthcare. During their conversations at Bartiméus, children indicated that the administration of eye drops constituted the most stressful element that needed to be improved. This study describes the amount of distress experienced by children when receiving eye drops. Furthermore, it investigates the value and impact of the developed eye drop booklet, for children and parents. Methods : In this multicenter study on distress related to the administration of eye drops, 370 children participated with ocular disorders or Cerebral Visual Impairment CVI (4-12 years), from four ophthalmology outpatient clinics. Half of the children, randomly chosen, were presented with a booklet before receiving eye drops. A faces scale together with a numeric scale (0-10) was used to determine the level of distress before and after the eye drops were administered. Parents were asked how satisfied they were about using the booklet. Results : The average distress score of the children who did receive a booklet was 3.40 at T1 and 2.70 at T2, and, of the children who did not receive a booklet, this was 3.69 at T1 and 2.97 at T2. The largest levels of distress were found in children between the ages of 7 and 9. The majority of parents indicated to appreciate the booklet, scoring it at 7.6 on a scale of 1 to 10. Furthermore, 91% of them considered the booklet a good idea or good preparation, 69% found it to have a positive effect on their child, and 83% would use it again. Conclusions : At T1 and T2, the differences in the children's distress scores were not statistically significant between the booklet group and the group who did not use the booklet. Children, generally, anticipated greater discomfort than what they actually experienced during the administration of eye drops. For most children, the booklet had a positive effect on their distress levels, but not for all. A large majority of parents noticed the added value of the booklet for their child. They were very positive and wanted to continue using the booklet in the future, as it appeared to give their child a sense of control during the administration of eye drops.",2020,"At T1 and T2, the differences in the children's distress scores were not statistically significant between the booklet group and the group who did not use the booklet.","['370 children participated with ocular disorders or Cerebral Visual Impairment CVI (4-12\xa0years), from four ophthalmology outpatient clinics', 'children and parents', 'children when receiving eye drops']",['eye drop booklet'],"[""children's distress scores"", 'largest levels of distress', 'average distress score']","[{'cui': 'C4517743', 'cui_str': '370'}, {'cui': 'C0008059', 'cui_str': 'Child'}, {'cui': 'C0015392', 'cui_str': 'Eye structure'}, {'cui': 'C0012634', 'cui_str': 'Disease'}, {'cui': 'C3810365', 'cui_str': 'Central visual impairment'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0029087', 'cui_str': 'Ophthalmology'}, {'cui': 'C0002424', 'cui_str': 'Ambulatory care site'}, {'cui': 'C0030551', 'cui_str': 'Parent'}, {'cui': 'C0015399', 'cui_str': 'Eye drops'}]","[{'cui': 'C0015399', 'cui_str': 'Eye drops'}, {'cui': 'C0030258', 'cui_str': 'Booklets'}]","[{'cui': 'C0008059', 'cui_str': 'Child'}, {'cui': 'C0231303', 'cui_str': 'Distress'}, {'cui': 'C0449820', 'cui_str': 'Score'}, {'cui': 'C0549177', 'cui_str': 'Large'}, {'cui': 'C0441889', 'cui_str': 'Levels'}]",370.0,0.0387859,"At T1 and T2, the differences in the children's distress scores were not statistically significant between the booklet group and the group who did not use the booklet.","[{'ForeName': 'Florine', 'Initials': 'F', 'LastName': 'Pilon', 'Affiliation': 'Bartiméus Diagnostic Center for Complex Visual Disorders, Zeist.'}, {'ForeName': 'Heleen', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Veen', 'Affiliation': 'Bartiméus Diagnostic Center for Complex Visual Disorders, Zeist.'}, {'ForeName': 'Sabina', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Kef', 'Affiliation': 'Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences, Section of Clinical Child and Family Studies, Part of the Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam.'}, {'ForeName': 'Maria M', 'Initials': 'MM', 'LastName': 'van Genderen', 'Affiliation': 'Bartiméus Diagnostic Center for Complex Visual Disorders, Zeist.'}]",Strabismus,['10.1080/09273972.2020.1752264']

This is a phase 2, placebo-controlled study. Patients received three ublituximab infusions (150 mg over 1-4 hours on day 1 and 450-600 mg over 1-3 hours on day 15 and week 24) in six dosing cohorts. The primary endpoint was B-cell depletion.
RESULTS


In all cohorts ( N  = 48), median B-cell depletion was >99% by week 4, maintained at weeks 24 and 48. Most common adverse events (AEs) were infusion-related reactions (all grade 1-2), with no apparent increased incidence at shorter infusion times. There were no AE-related discontinuations. At weeks 24 and 48, no T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions ( p  = 0.003) and a 10.6% decrease in T2 lesion volume ( p  = 0.002) were detected. The annualized relapse rate was 0.07; 93% remained relapse free on study. Overall, 74% of patients had no evidence of disease activity (NEDA).
CONCLUSION


Ublituximab was safely infused as rapid as 1 hour, producing robust B-cell depletion and profound reductions in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity and relapses.",2020,"At weeks 24 and 48, no T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions ( p  = 0.003) and a 10.6% decrease in T2 lesion volume ( p  = 0.002) were detected.",['patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis'],"['ublituximab', 'glycoengineered anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody', 'ublituximab infusions', 'placebo']","['magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity and relapses', 'B-cell depletion', 'disease activity (NEDA', 'annualized relapse rate', 'T2 lesion volume', 'median B-cell depletion']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0035020', 'cui_str': 'Relapse phase'}, {'cui': 'C0205431', 'cui_str': 'Formed'}, {'cui': 'C0026769', 'cui_str': 'Multiple sclerosis'}]","[{'cui': 'C4083151', 'cui_str': 'ublituximab'}, {'cui': 'C0796614', 'cui_str': 'ocaratuzumab'}, {'cui': 'C0574032', 'cui_str': 'Infusion'}, {'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}]","[{'cui': 'C0024485', 'cui_str': 'Magnetic resonance imaging'}, {'cui': 'C0026606', 'cui_str': 'Physical activity'}, {'cui': 'C0035020', 'cui_str': 'Relapse phase'}, {'cui': 'C0004561', 'cui_str': 'B lymphocyte'}, {'cui': 'C0333668', 'cui_str': 'Depletion'}, {'cui': 'C0012634', 'cui_str': 'Disease'}, {'cui': 'C0221198', 'cui_str': 'Lesion'}, {'cui': 'C0449468', 'cui_str': 'Volume'}, {'cui': 'C0549183', 'cui_str': 'Midline'}]",,0.0336332,"At weeks 24 and 48, no T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions ( p  = 0.003) and a 10.6% decrease in T2 lesion volume ( p  = 0.002) were detected.","[{'ForeName': 'Edward', 'Initials': 'E', 'LastName': 'Fox', 'Affiliation': 'Central Texas Neurology Consultants, Round Rock, TX, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Amy E', 'Initials': 'AE', 'LastName': 'Lovett-Racke', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Microbial Infection and Immunity, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Matthew', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Gormley', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Microbial Infection and Immunity, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Yue', 'Initials': 'Y', 'LastName': 'Liu', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Microbial Infection and Immunity, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Maria', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Petracca', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Sirio', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Cocozza', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA/Department of Advanced Biomedical Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.'}, {'ForeName': 'Richard', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Shubin', 'Affiliation': 'SC3 Research Group, Inc., Pasadena, CA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Sibyl', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Wray', 'Affiliation': 'Hope Neurology Multiple Sclerosis Center, Knoxville, TN, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Michael S', 'Initials': 'MS', 'LastName': 'Weiss', 'Affiliation': 'TG Therapeutics, Inc., New York, NY, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jenna A', 'Initials': 'JA', 'LastName': 'Bosco', 'Affiliation': 'TG Therapeutics, Inc., New York, NY, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Sean A', 'Initials': 'SA', 'LastName': 'Power', 'Affiliation': 'TG Therapeutics, Inc., New York, NY, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Koby', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Mok', 'Affiliation': 'TG Therapeutics, Inc., New York, NY, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Matilde', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Inglese', 'Affiliation': 'Medical Center, Department of Neurology, Radiology and Neuroscience, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.'}]","Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)",['10.1177/1352458520918375']

514,32351586,Effects of diet versus diet plus aerobic and resistance exercise on metabolic syndrome in obese young men.,"Background


Diet and physical activity are the most commonly recommended strategies for preventing and treating metabolic syndrome (MetS). This randomized trial aims to examine the effectiveness of a weight reduction intervention based on caloric restriction, low-impact aerobics (LIA), and a resistance-training program in improving body composition, metabolic parameters and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors among obese students diagnosed with MetS.
Methods


In all, 23 male participants, aged 19-24 years, were randomly introduced to a dieting program (the diet group, or DG = 09) or to dieting associated with a supervised physical training program (the diet plus training group, or DTG = 14). Before and after the intervention, the participants' anthropometric measures and cardiovascular disease risk factors were assessed.
Results


Following the diet-based intervention, significant improvements were noted in BMI (p = 0.39), PBF (p = 0.022) and LDL-c (p = 0.024). However, in response to the diet plus aerobic and resistance exercise intervention, obese participants had significant reductions in body weight (p = 0.018), WC (p = 0.042), BMI (p = 0.001), BFP (p < 0.001), DBP (p = 0.013), SBP (p = 0.016), TG level (p = 0.026), TC (p = 0.016), LDL-c (p = 0.001) and VLDL-c (p = 0.026). Notable differences were also observed between groups in terms of changes in WC (p = 0.003), BFP (p = 0.05), WHR (p = 0.029), FBG level (p = 0.022), TG level (p = 0.001), TC (p = 0.006), LDL-c (p = 0.014) and VLDL-c (p < 0.001).
Conclusion


Diet-based intervention could be an effective tool in reducing body composition and some MetS components. However, adding three weekly aerobic and resistance-training sessions to the dieting program may deliver better outcomes, particularly in terms of reducing WC, BFP, WHR, FBG level, TG level, TC, LDL-c, and VLDL-c.",2020,"Notable differences were also observed between groups in terms of changes in WC (p = 0.003), BFP (p = 0.05), WHR (p = 0.029), FBG level (p = 0.022), TG level (p = 0.001), TC (p = 0.006), LDL-c (p = 0.014) and VLDL-c (p < 0.001).

Although the positive effects of resistance training (RT) on strength and functional capacity have been well evidenced in the scientific literature, the effects of RT on blood pressure and the relationship of these responses with performance improvement are not yet well established.
Objective


This study aimed to analyze the effects of three and six months of RT on the hemodynamic parameters and functional capacity of hypertensive and normotensive women.
Method


Sixteen hypertensive and 15 normotensive elderly women participated in a RT protocol designed to increase muscle strength and hypertrophy, lasting six months, twice a week.
Results


Systolic blood pressure (SBP) had a reduction at six months only in hypertensive patients, while diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased at six months of intervention in both groups (p < 0.05). SBP showed differences between the groups in the pretest (p < 0.05), but not at three and six months of intervention (p > 0.05). Heart rate (HR) was reduced at three months in hypertensive patients, and at six months in the normotensive (p < 0.05). The strength and functional mobility of both hypertensive and normotensive individuals significantly increased at three and six months of intervention (p < 0.05).

Limited studies have assessed the effect of moderate-intensity continuous aerobic exercise on hepatic fat content and visceral lipids in hepatic patients with diabesity. This study was designed to evaluate hepatic fat content and visceral lipids following moderate-intensity continuous aerobic exercise in hepatic patients with diabesity.
Design


A single-blinded randomised controlled trial.
Methods


Thirty-one diabetic obese patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were recruited into this study. The patients were randomly classified into exercise and control groups, fifteen patients in the exercise group and sixteen patients in the control group. The exercise group received an 8-week moderate-intensity continuous aerobic exercise program with standard medical treatment, while the control group received standard medical treatment without any exercise program. Hepatic fat content and visceral lipids were assessed before and after intervention at the end of the study.
Results


Baseline and clinical characteristics showed a nonsignificant difference between the two groups ( p  > 0.05). At the end of the intervention, the aerobic exercise showed significant improvements (serum triglycerides and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs),  p  ≤ 0.002, total cholesterol,  p =0.004, visceral fats,  p =0.016, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C),  p =0.022, high-density lipoproteins (HDLs),  p =0.038, alanine transaminases (AL),  p =0.044, intrahepatic triglyceride and HOMA-IR,  p =0.046, and body mass index (BMI),  p =0.047), while the control group showed a nonsignificant difference ( p  > 0.05). The postintervention analysis showed significant differences in favor of the aerobic exercise group ( p  < 0.05).

517,32351602,Group versus Individual Acupuncture (AP) for Cancer Pain: A Randomized Noninferiority Trial.,"Background


A service delivery model using group acupuncture (AP) may be more cost-effective than individual AP in general, but there is little evidence to assess whether group AP is a comparable treatment in terms of efficacy to standard individual AP. The study aimed to compare the group to individual delivery of 6-week AP among cancer patients with pain.
Methods


The study design was a randomized noninferiority trial of the individual (gold standard treatment) vs. group AP for cancer pain. The primary outcome was pain interference and severity, measured through the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Secondary outcomes included measures of mood, sleep, fatigue, and social support. Changes in outcomes from pre- to postintervention were examined using linear mixed effects modeling and noninferiority was inferred using a noninferiority margin, a difference of change between the two arms and 95% CIs. Pain interference was tested with a noninferiority margin of 1 on the BPI, while pain severity and secondary outcomes were compared using conventional statistical methods.
Results


The trial included 74 participants randomly allocated to group (35) or individual (39) AP. The noninferiority hypothesis was supported for pain interference [Ө - 1, Δ 1.03, 95% CI: 0.15-2.20] and severity [Ө - 0.81, Δ 0.52, 95% CI:.33-1.38] as well as for mood [Ө - 7.52, Δ 9.86, 95% CI: 0.85-18.86], sleep [Ө - 1.65, Δ 2.60, 95% CI: 0.33-4.88], fatigue [Ө 8.54, Δ - 15.57, 95% CI: 25.60-5.54], and social support [Ө.26, Δ - 0.15, 95% CI:  - 0.42-0.13], meaning that group AP was not inferior to individual AP treatment. Both arms evidenced statistically significant improvements across all symptoms before and after the intervention. Effect sizes for the group vs. individual AP on outcomes of pain, sleep, mood, and social support ranged from small to very large and were consistently larger in the group condition. The total average cost-per-person for group AP ($221.25) was almost half that of individual AP ($420).
Conclusions


This is the first study to examine the noninferiority of group AP with the gold standard individual AP. Group AP was noninferior to individual AP for treating cancer pain and was superior in many health outcomes. Group AP is more cost-effective for alleviating cancer pain and should be considered for implementation trials.",2020,"The noninferiority hypothesis was supported for pain interference [Ө - 1, Δ 1.03, 95% CI: 0.15-2.20] and severity [Ө - 0.81, Δ 0.52, 95% CI:.33-1.38] as well as for mood [Ө - 7.52, Δ 9.86, 95% CI: 0.85-18.86], sleep [Ө - 1.65, Δ 2.60, 95% CI: 0.33-4.88], fatigue [Ө 8.54, Δ - 15.57, 95% CI: 25.60-5.54], and social support [Ө.26, Δ - 0.15, 95% CI:  - 0.42-0.13], meaning that group AP was not inferior to individual AP treatment.","['Cancer Pain', 'for cancer pain', 'cancer patients with pain', '74 participants randomly allocated to group (35) or individual (39) AP']","['Individual Acupuncture (AP', 'acupuncture (AP', 'individual (gold standard treatment) vs. group AP']","['measures of mood, sleep, fatigue, and social support', 'Pain interference', 'total average cost-per-person', 'fatigue', 'pain interference and severity, measured through the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI', 'pain interference', 'pain, sleep, mood, and social support']","[{'cui': 'C0596240', 'cui_str': 'Cancer pain'}, {'cui': 'C0006826', 'cui_str': 'Malignant neoplastic disease'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0030193', 'cui_str': 'Pain'}, {'cui': 'C0439745', 'cui_str': 'Grouped'}, {'cui': 'C0027361', 'cui_str': 'Person'}, {'cui': 'C0001299', 'cui_str': 'Acupuncture'}]","[{'cui': 'C0027361', 'cui_str': 'Person'}, {'cui': 'C0001299', 'cui_str': 'Acupuncture'}, {'cui': 'C0018026', 'cui_str': 'Gold'}, {'cui': 'C0038137', 'cui_str': 'standards'}, {'cui': 'C0039798', 'cui_str': 'therapy'}, {'cui': 'C0439745', 'cui_str': 'Grouped'}]","[{'cui': 'C0079809', 'cui_str': 'Measure'}, {'cui': 'C0026516', 'cui_str': 'Mood'}, {'cui': 'C0037313', 'cui_str': 'Sleep'}, {'cui': 'C0015672', 'cui_str': 'Fatigue'}, {'cui': 'C0037438', 'cui_str': 'Social support'}, {'cui': 'C0030193', 'cui_str': 'Pain'}, {'cui': 'C0521102', 'cui_str': 'Interferes with'}, {'cui': 'C0439810', 'cui_str': 'Total'}, {'cui': 'C0010186', 'cui_str': 'Cost'}, {'cui': 'C0027361', 'cui_str': 'Person'}, {'cui': 'C0439793', 'cui_str': 'Severities'}, {'cui': 'C0453896', 'cui_str': 'Briefs'}, {'cui': 'C0021941', 'cui_str': 'Inventories'}]",74.0,0.108261,"The noninferiority hypothesis was supported for pain interference [Ө - 1, Δ 1.03, 95% CI: 0.15-2.20] and severity [Ө - 0.81, Δ 0.52, 95% CI:.33-1.38] as well as for mood [Ө - 7.52, Δ 9.86, 95% CI: 0.85-18.86], sleep [Ө - 1.65, Δ 2.60, 95% CI: 0.33-4.88], fatigue [Ө 8.54, Δ - 15.57, 95% CI: 25.60-5.54], and social support [Ө.26, Δ - 0.15, 95% CI:  - 0.42-0.13], meaning that group AP was not inferior to individual AP treatment.","[{'ForeName': 'Erica Nicole', 'Initials': 'EN', 'LastName': 'Reed', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Psychosocial Oncology, Department of Oncology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jessa', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Landmann', 'Affiliation': 'Vive Integrative Health Group, 1889 45 Street NW, Calgary, AB, Canada.'}, {'ForeName': 'Devesh', 'Initials': 'D', 'LastName': 'Oberoi', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Psychosocial Oncology, Department of Oncology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.'}, {'ForeName': 'Katherine-Ann L', 'Initials': 'KL', 'LastName': 'Piedalue', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Psychosocial Oncology, Department of Oncology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.'}, {'ForeName': 'Peter', 'Initials': 'P', 'LastName': 'Faris', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Analytics, Alberta Health Services (AHS) and Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.'}, {'ForeName': 'Linda E', 'Initials': 'LE', 'LastName': 'Carlson', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Psychosocial Oncology, Department of Oncology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.'}]",Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,['10.1155/2020/7209548']
518,32356634,[Use of Nordic walking in the complex treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in chronic prostatitis].,"INTRODUCTION


Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) caused by chronic prostatitis (CP) are a common condition. Standard antibiotic therapy is often not justified, since bacterial prostatitis is presented in up to 10% of the cases, while there is no effect on the risk factors for the development and relapse of the disease. This study is aimed at one of the main risk factors for LUTS - a sedentary lifestyle.
AIM


To increase the effectiveness of treatment for LUTS in men using the Nordic Walking technique.
MATERIAL AND METHODS


84 patients with CP were examined, which were divided into 3 groups. The 1st group (control) included 32 patients who received standard antibacterial therapy. In the 2nd group (primary) - 32 patients who received complex therapy (antibiotic therapy + 4-week course of Nordic walking). The third group (comparison) included 20 patients who were prescribed monotherapy - Nordic walking for 4 weeks. The dynamics of clinical manifestations was assessed using CP Symptom Scale (NIH-CPSI) and the international symptom index for diseases of the prostate IPSS; the volume of residual urine, uroflowmetric data, and the level of leukocytes in the secretion of the prostate gland were estimated.
RESULTS


Laboratory studies showed a significantly faster decrease in the number of leukocytes in the secretion of the prostate gland on the 7th and 14th day in the primary (2nd) group ( p <0.001). Clinical symptoms according to the NIH-CPSI and IPSS scales significantly regressed in the primary group on the 14th and 28th days of therapy. Uroflowmetric data and the volume of residual urine improved more significantly in the primary group by the 14th and 28th days.
CONCLUSION


Patients receiving combined therapy showed significantly better treatment results in the form of faster normalization of prostate secretion, regression of clinical symptoms, improved urine flow rate and a decrease in residual urine volume after 4 weeks of therapy. When choosing management algorithm for patients with LUTS, it is advisable to use an integrated approach: in addition to antibiotic therapy, Nordic walking is recommended 3 times a week for at least 4 weeks.",2020,"Uroflowmetric data and the volume of residual urine improved more significantly in the primary group by the 14th and 28th days.

519,32356772,Improving Hand Hygiene Compliance in Nursing Homes: Protocol for a Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (HANDSOME Study).,"BACKGROUND


Hand hygiene compliance is considered the most (cost-)effective measure for preventing health care-associated infections. While hand hygiene interventions have frequently been implemented and assessed in hospitals, there is limited knowledge about hand hygiene compliance in other health care settings and which interventions and implementation methods are effective.
OBJECTIVE


This study aims to evaluate the effect of a multimodal intervention to increase hand hygiene compliance of nurses in nursing homes through a cluster randomized controlled trial (HANDSOME study).
METHODS


Nursing homes were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 trial arms: receiving the intervention at a predetermined date, receiving the identical intervention after an infectious disease outbreak, or serving as a control arm. Hand hygiene was evaluated in nursing homes by direct observation at 4 timepoints. We documented compliance with the World Health Organization's 5 moments of hand hygiene, specifically before touching a patient, before a clean/aseptic procedure, after body fluid exposure risk, after touching a patient, and after touching patient surroundings. The primary outcome is hand hygiene compliance of the nurses to the standards of the World Health Organization. The secondary outcome is infectious disease incidence among residents. Infectious disease incidence was documented by a staff member at each nursing home unit. Outcomes will be compared with the presence of norovirus, rhinovirus, and Escherichia coli on surfaces in the nursing homes, as measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS


The study was funded in September 2015. Data collection started in October 2016 and was completed in October 2017. Data analysis will be completed in 2020.
CONCLUSIONS


HANDSOME studies the effectiveness of a hand hygiene intervention specifically for the nursing home environment. Nurses were taught the World Health Organization's 5 moments of hand hygiene guidelines using the slogan ""Room In, Room Out, Before Clean, After Dirty,"" which was developed for nursing staff to better understand and remember the hygiene guidelines. HANDSOME should contribute to improved hand hygiene practice and a reduction in infectious disease rates and related mortality.

520,32356774,Effectiveness of a Quit Vaping Text Message Program in Promoting Abstinence Among Young Adult E-Cigarette Users: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND


Millions of young adults currently vape electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), yet little research on vaping cessation interventions exists. Text messaging is a promising, scalable intervention strategy for delivering vaping cessation treatment.
OBJECTIVE


This study evaluates the effectiveness of a text message quit vaping program (This is Quitting) in promoting abstinence from e-cigarettes among young adults; examines changes in self-efficacy, perceived social norms, and social support for quitting as hypothesized mediators of effectiveness; and examines if treatment effectiveness is moderated by gender, race, ethnicity, or sexual minority status.
METHODS


Overall, 2600 young adult (aged 18-24 years) e-cigarette users in the United States will be recruited via web advertisements to participate in the study. Participants will be randomized to This is Quitting or an assessment-only control condition. The primary outcome measure is 30-day vaping abstinence at 7 months post enrollment.
RESULTS


Study recruitment began on December 18, 2019, and is projected to be completed by spring 2020. The final 7-month follow-up is anticipated to be completed by fall/winter 2020. Because this is the first-ever evaluation of a quit vaping program, we were unable to draw on existing literature to determine the appropriate sample size. Therefore, we examined abstinence rates among an initial pilot sample of 269 participants (This is Quitting: n=148 and control: n=121) who completed the 1-month follow-up to determine the final sample size. The 1-month response rate was 79.2% (213/269), with no difference between arms. Using intention-to-treat analyses that counted nonresponders as still vaping, 30-day abstinence rates were 16.2% (24/148) among those randomized to This is Quitting and 8.3% (10/121) among those randomized to control. A treatment difference of 16% vs 8% is detectable with 80% power at 2-sided alpha=.05 with 260/group (520 total). To detect treatment differences of this magnitude in a 20% subsample (eg, Hispanic or sexual minority young adult e-cigarette users), we will enroll 1300/group (2600 total).
CONCLUSIONS


The scientific, clinical, and public health communities are desperate for cessation resources to address vaping among young people. This study is the first-ever comparative effectiveness trial of an intervention to help young people quit vaping. It focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of a theory-grounded, empirically informed text message intervention among young adults. The study is fully powered to examine potentially important subgroup differences among young people who are more vulnerable to e-cigarette use. Although potentially more challenging from a research ethics and pragmatic standpoint, evaluating quit vaping intervention approaches in teens is an important area for future research. Data from this trial will establish a benchmark of effectiveness for other vaping cessation programs and begin to create a body of evidence focused on how best to help young people break free from e-cigarettes.

521,32297974,Interventions for fatigue in inflammatory bowel disease.,"BACKGROUND


Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an umbrella term used to describe a group of chronic, progressive inflammatory disorders of the digestive tract. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are the two main types. Fatigue is a common, debilitating and burdensome symptom experienced by individuals with IBD. The subjective, complex nature of fatigue can often hamper its management. The efficacy and safety of pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatments for fatigue in IBD is not yet established through systematic review of studies.
OBJECTIVES


To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for managing fatigue in IBD compared to no treatment, placebo or active comparator.
SEARCH METHODS


A systematic search of the databases Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO was undertaken from inception to July 2018. A top-up search was run in October 2019. We also searched the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ongoing trials and research registers, conference abstracts and reference lists for potentially eligible studies.
SELECTION CRITERIA


Randomised controlled trials of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions in children or adults with IBD, where fatigue was assessed as a primary or secondary outcome using a generic or disease-specific fatigue measure, a subscale of a larger quality of life scale or as a single-item measure, were included.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS


Two authors independently screened search results and four authors extracted and assessed bias independently using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. The primary outcome was fatigue and the secondary outcomes included quality of life, adverse events (AEs), serious AEs and withdrawal due to AEs. Standard methodological procedures were used.
MAIN RESULTS


We included 14 studies (3741 participants): nine trials of pharmacological interventions and five trials of non-pharmacological interventions. Thirty ongoing studies were identified, and five studies are awaiting classification. Data on fatigue were available from nine trials (1344 participants). In only four trials was managing fatigue the primary intention of the intervention (electroacupuncture, physical activity advice, cognitive behavioural therapy and solution-focused therapy). Electroacupuncture Fatigue was measured with Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F) (scores range from 0 to 52). The FACIT-F score at week eight was 8.00 points higher (better) in participants receiving electroacupuncture compared with no treatment (mean difference (MD) 8.00, 95% CI 6.45 to 9.55; 1 RCT; 27 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results at week 16 could not be calculated. FACIT-F scores were also higher with electroacupuncture compared to sham electroacupuncture at week eight (MD 5.10, 95% CI 3.49 to 6.71; 1 RCT; 30 participants; low-certainty evidence) but not at week 16 (MD 2.60, 95% CI 0.74 to 4.46; 1 RCT; 30 participants; low-certainty evidence). No adverse events were reported, except for one adverse event in the sham electroacupuncture group. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and solution-focused therapy Compared with a fatigue information leaflet, the effects of CBT on fatigue are very uncertain (Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Fatigue (IBD-F) section I: MD -2.16, 95% CI -6.13 to 1.81; IBD-F section II: MD -21.62, 95% CI -45.02 to 1.78; 1 RCT, 18 participants, very low-certainty evidence). The efficacy of solution-focused therapy on fatigue is also very uncertain, because standard summary data were not reported (1 RCT, 98 participants). Physical activity advice One 2 x 2 factorial trial (45 participants) found physical activity advice may reduce fatigue but the evidence is very uncertain. At week 12, compared to a control group receiving no physical activity advice plus omega 3 capsules, FACIT-F scores were higher (better) in the physical activity advice plus omega 3 group (FACIT-F MD 6.40, 95% CI -1.80 to 14.60, very low-certainty evidence) and the physical activity advice plus placebo group (FACIT-F MD 9.00, 95% CI 1.64 to 16.36, very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were predominantly gastrointestinal and similar across physical activity groups, although more adverse events were reported in the no physical activity advice plus omega 3 group. Pharmacological interventions Compared with placebo, adalimumab 40 mg, administered every other week ('eow') (only for those known to respond to adalimumab induction therapy), may reduce fatigue in patients with moderately-to-severely active Crohn's disease, but the evidence is very uncertain (FACIT-F MD 4.30, 95% CI 1.75 to 6.85; very low-certainty evidence). The adalimumab 40 mg eow group was less likely to experience serious adverse events (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.96; 521 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and withdrawal due to adverse events (OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.87; 521 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Ferric maltol may result in a slight increase in fatigue, with better SF-36 vitality scores reported in the placebo group compared to the treatment group following 12 weeks of treatment (MD -9.31, 95% CI -17.15 to -1.47; 118 participants; low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference in adverse events (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.18; 120 participants; low-certainty evidence) AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The effects of interventions for the management of fatigue in IBD are uncertain. No firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions can be drawn. Further high-quality studies, with a larger number of participants, are required to assess the potential benefits and harms of therapies. Future studies should assess interventions specifically designed for fatigue management, targeted at selected IBD populations, and measure fatigue as the primary outcome.",2020,"The FACIT-F score at week eight was 8.00 points higher (better) in participants receiving electroacupuncture compared with no treatment (mean difference (MD) 8.00, 95% CI 6.45 to 9.55;

523,32356923,Evaluating the Perceived Efficacy of Randomized Security Measures at Airports.,"Both the increase in traveler numbers and the heightened threat posed by terrorism in recent years represent significant challenges to airport security measures. To ensure that a high level of security is maintained, randomized security checks have been proposed as a promising alternative to traditional security approaches. The use of randomized checks means that only a specific number of people are selected for security screening. However, the likely effects of such a change in security procedures on travelers' security perceptions and on the deterrence of criminal activities remain unclear. Thus, the present study examines how varying the percentage of people screened during security checks influences people's security perceptions. In two online experiments, the participants were asked to imagine that they sought to smuggle an explosive dummy past an airport security check. The only information provided was the number of people screened during security checks, which was manipulated between-subjects in the first experiment and within-subjects in the second experiment. The participants then had to rate their security perception (i.e., the perceived likelihood of successfully smuggling the explosive dummy). The findings show that people perceive traditional security checks to be safer than randomized checks, irrespective of whether 90% or 30% of people are screened. Hence, if randomized security checks would indeed be implemented, it would automatically lead to a decreased perception of security. Furthermore, this decreased security perception might lead to an actual reduction in security, as the deterrence of criminal activities could also be reduced.",2020,"The findings show that people perceive traditional security checks to be safer than randomized checks, irrespective of whether 90% or 30% of people are screened.",[],[],['rate their security perception'],[],[],"[{'cui': 'C0030971', 'cui_str': 'Perception'}]",,0.0315659,"The findings show that people perceive traditional security checks to be safer than randomized checks, irrespective of whether 90% or 30% of people are screened.","[{'ForeName': 'Tamara', 'Initials': 'T', 'LastName': 'Stotz', 'Affiliation': 'ETH Zurich, Consumer Behavior, Zurich, 8092, Switzerland.'}, {'ForeName': 'Angela', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Bearth', 'Affiliation': 'ETH Zurich, Consumer Behavior, Zurich, 8092, Switzerland.'}, {'ForeName': 'Signe Maria', 'Initials': 'SM', 'LastName': 'Ghelfi', 'Affiliation': 'Zurich State Police, Airport Division - Research and Development, P.O.

524,32356926,Telmisartan as tentative angiotensin receptor blocker therapeutic for COVID-19.,"In late 2019, a new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan Province, China, causing lung complications similar to those produced by the SARS coronavirus in the 2002-2003 epidemic. This new disease was named COVID-19 and the causative virus SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the airway and binds, by means of the S protein on its surface to the membrane protein ACE2 in type 2 alveolar cells. The S protein-ACE2 complex is internalized by endocytosis leading to a partial decrease or total loss of the enzymatic function ACE2 in the alveolar cells and in turn increasing the tissue concentration of pro-inflammatory angiotensin II by decreasing its degradation and reducing the concentration of its physiological antagonist angiotensin 1-7. High levels of angiotensin II on the lung interstitium can promote apoptosis initiating an inflammatory process with release of proinflammatory cytokines, establishing a self-powered cascade, leading eventually to ARDS. Recently, Gurwitz proposed the tentative use of agents such as losartan and telmisartan as alternative options for treating COVID-19 patients prior to development of ARDS. In this commentary article, the authors make the case for the election of telmisartan as such alternative on the basis of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and present an open-label randomized phase II clinical trial for the evaluation of telmisartan in COVID-19 patients (NCT04355936).",2020,"In late 2019, a new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan Province, China, causing lung complications similar to those produced by the SARS coronavirus in the 2002-2003 epidemic.",[],"['Telmisartan', 'telmisartan', 'losartan and telmisartan']",[],[],"[{'cui': 'C0248719', 'cui_str': 'telmisartan'}, {'cui': 'C0126174', 'cui_str': 'Losartan'}]",[],,0.0151336,"In late 2019, a new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan Province, China, causing lung complications similar to those produced by the SARS coronavirus in the 2002-2003 epidemic.","[{'ForeName': 'Rodolfo Pedro', 'Initials': 'RP', 'LastName': 'Rothlin', 'Affiliation': 'Sociedad Argentina de Farmacología Clínica, Asociación Médica Argentina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.'}, {'ForeName': 'Héctor Miguel', 'Initials': 'HM', 'LastName': 'Vetulli', 'Affiliation': 'Servicio de Electrofisiología Cardíaca, Arritmias y Marcapasos, Sanatorio Otamendi y Miroli, Buenos Aires, Argentina.'}, {'ForeName': 'Mariano', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Duarte', 'Affiliation': 'Hospital de Clínicas ""José de San Martín"", Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.'}, {'ForeName': 'Facundo Germán', 'Initials': 'FG', 'LastName': 'Pelorosso', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, Hospital de Alta Complejidad El Calafate SAMIC, Santa Cruz, Argentina.'}]",Drug development research,['10.1002/ddr.21679']

526,32351412,Dissociable Effects of Theta-Burst Repeated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to the Inferior Frontal Gyrus on Inhibitory Control in Nicotine Addiction.,"Nicotine addiction, like other substance use disorders (SUD's), is associated with deficits in prefrontal mediated inhibitory control. The strength of inhibitory control task-based functional connectivity (tbFC) between the right inferior frontal gyrus (r.IFG) and thalamus (corticothalamic circuit) mediates the association between successful inhibition and smoking relapse vulnerability. However, the potential efficacy of theta burst stimulation (TBS) to the r.IFG, a treatment known to alter clinical symptoms among neuropsychiatric patients, has not been reported in a SUD population. This study utilized fMRI guided neuronavigation to examine the effects of TBS on inhibitory control among nicotine dependent individuals. Participants ( N =12) were scanned while performing an inhibitory control task known to elicit inhibition-related activity in the r.IFG. Using a randomized, counterbalanced cross-over design, participants then received TBS over two visits: excitatory (iTBS) on one visit and inhibitory (cTBS) TBS on the other visit. The effects of each TBS condition on subsequent inhibitory control task performance were examined. A significant condition x time interaction was identified on trials requiring inhibitory control (F (1,10) = 7.27,  p  = .022,  D  = 1.63). iTBS improved inhibitory control, whereas cTBS impaired inhibitory control.

527,32351421,Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation Does Not Affect Verbal Memory Performance in Healthy Volunteers.,"Introduction


Invasive vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) improves word recognition memory in patients with epilepsy. Recent studies with transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) have also shown positive effects on various subdomains of cognitive functioning in healthy volunteers. In this randomized, controlled, crossover study, we investigated the effect of tVNS on a word recognition memory paradigm in healthy volunteers to further investigate the potential of tVNS in the treatment of cognitive disorders.
Methods


We included 41 healthy participants aged between 18 and 30 years (young age group) and 24 healthy participants aged between 45 and 80 years (older age group). Each participant completed a word recognition memory paradigm during three different conditions: true tVNS, sham, and control. During true tVNS, stimulation was delivered at the cymba conchae. Sham stimulation was delivered by stimulating the earlobe. In the control condition, no stimulation was given. In each condition, participants were asked to remember highlighted words from three test paragraphs. Accuracy scores were calculated for immediate recall after each test paragraph and for delayed recognition at the end of the paradigm. We hypothesized that highlighted words from paragraphs in the true tVNS condition would be more accurately recalled and/or recognized compared to highlighted words from paragraphs in the sham or control condition.
Results


In this randomized study, tVNS did not affect the accuracy scores for immediate recall or delayed recognition in both age groups. The younger group showed significantly higher accuracy scores than the older group. The accuracy scores improved over time, and the most recently learned words were better recognized. Participants rated true tVNS as significantly more painful; however, pain was not found to affect accuracy scores.
Conclusion


In this study, tVNS did not affect verbal memory performance in healthy volunteers. Our results could not replicate the positive effects of invasive VNS on word recognition memory in epilepsy patients. Future research with the aim of improving cognitive function should focus on the rational identification of optimized and individualized stimulation settings primarily in patients with cognitive deficits.",2020,"In this randomized study, tVNS did not affect the accuracy scores for immediate recall or delayed recognition in both age groups.","['healthy volunteers', 'patients with cognitive deficits', 'epilepsy patients', 'patients with epilepsy', 'Healthy Volunteers', '41 healthy participants aged between 18 and 30 years (young age group) and 24 healthy participants aged between 45 and 80 years (older age group']","['tVNS', 'transcutaneous VNS (tVNS', 'Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation', 'Introduction\n\n\nInvasive vagus nerve stimulation (VNS']","['Verbal Memory Performance', 'Accuracy scores', 'verbal memory performance', 'accuracy scores', 'word recognition memory']","[{'cui': 'C1708335', 'cui_str': 'Healthy Participants'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0009241', 'cui_str': 'Cognitive disorder'}, {'cui': 'C0014544', 'cui_str': 'Epilepsy'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0332239', 'cui_str': 'Young'}, {'cui': 'C0027362', 'cui_str': 'Age Groups'}, {'cui': 'C0231337', 'cui_str': 'Senility'}, {'cui': 'C0439745', 'cui_str': 'Grouped'}]","[{'cui': 'C2350432', 'cui_str': 'Vagal Nerve Stimulation'}, {'cui': 'C0205281', 'cui_str': 'Invasive'}]","[{'cui': 'C0561770', 'cui_str': 'Verbal memory observable'}, {'cui': 'C0443131', 'cui_str': 'Accurate'}, {'cui': 'C0449820', 'cui_str': 'Score'}, {'cui': 'C0042926', 'cui_str': 'Vocabulary'}, {'cui': 'C0524637', 'cui_str': 'Recognition'}]",41.0,0.0740058,"In this randomized study, tVNS did not affect the accuracy scores for immediate recall or delayed recognition in both age groups.","[{'ForeName': 'Ann', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Mertens', 'Affiliation': '4Brain, Department of Neurology, Institute for Neuroscience, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'ForeName': 'Lien', 'Initials': 'L', 'LastName': 'Naert', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Experimental Psychology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'ForeName': 'Marijke', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Miatton', 'Affiliation': '4Brain, Department of Neurology, Institute for Neuroscience, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'ForeName': 'Tasha', 'Initials': 'T', 'LastName': 'Poppa', 'Affiliation': 'Ghent Experimental Psychiatry (GHEP) Lab, Department of Psychiatry, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'ForeName': 'Evelien', 'Initials': 'E', 'LastName': 'Carrette', 'Affiliation': '4Brain, Department of Neurology, Institute for Neuroscience, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'ForeName': 'Stefanie', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Gadeyne', 'Affiliation': '4Brain, Department of Neurology, Institute for Neuroscience, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'ForeName': 'Robrecht', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Raedt', 'Affiliation': '4Brain, Department of Neurology, Institute for Neuroscience, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'ForeName': 'Paul', 'Initials': 'P', 'LastName': 'Boon', 'Affiliation': '4Brain, Department of Neurology, Institute for Neuroscience, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kristl', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Vonck', 'Affiliation': '4Brain, Department of Neurology, Institute for Neuroscience, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}]",Frontiers in psychology,['10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00551']
528,32351447,Prospect of Sodium-Glucose Co-transporter 2 Inhibitors Combined With Insulin for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes.,"Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new family of antidiabetic drugs that reduce blood glucose independent of insulin. In this review, we present the advantages and adverse effects of SGLT2 inhibitors plus insulin therapy as a treatment regimen for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Compared with placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors plus insulin therapy could significantly decrease fasting blood glucose and HbA1c, thereby reducing the daily required dose of insulin. A reduction in body weight and improvements in insulin resistance and β-cell function have also been widely reported with this therapy, and other potential advantages, including the reduction in blood pressure, adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and visceral adipose tissue volume, have been revealed. SGLT2 inhibitors cause a greater reduction than dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in body weight and the risk of cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, compared with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors reduce blood pressure, and heart failure. As this therapy is an oral preparation, an improvement in patient compliance is also achieved. Despite these advantages, however, combination therapy with SGLT2 inhibitors and insulin has several risks. Although no difference has been found in the incidence of hypoglycemic events and urinary tract infection between the administration of this combination and that of placebo, the risk of genital tract infections was reported to increase with the combination therapy. Additionally, bone adverse effects, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, and volume depletion-and osmotic diuresis-related adverse effects have been observed. Altogether, we could conclude that SGLT2 inhibitors plus insulin therapy is an efficient treatment option for patients with T2D, especially those requiring high daily insulin doses and those with insulin resistance, obesity, and a high risk of cardiovascular events. However, careful monitoring of the adverse effects of this combination is also warranted.",2020,"Although no difference has been found in the incidence of hypoglycemic events and urinary tract infection between the administration of this combination and that of placebo, the risk of genital tract infections was reported to increase with the combination therapy.","['patients with T2D', 'Type 2 Diabetes', 'patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D']","['Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors', 'placebo', 'inhibitors plus insulin therapy', 'SGLT2 inhibitors plus insulin therapy', 'SGLT2', 'Sodium-Glucose Co-transporter 2 Inhibitors Combined With Insulin', 'placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors plus insulin therapy', 'glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors']","['risk of genital tract infections', 'fasting blood glucose and HbA1c, thereby reducing the daily required dose of insulin', 'blood pressure, and heart failure', 'hypoglycemic events and urinary tract infection', 'body weight', 'blood pressure, adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and visceral adipose tissue volume', 'bone adverse effects, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, and volume depletion-and osmotic diuresis-related adverse effects', 'insulin resistance and β-cell function']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0332307', 'cui_str': 'Type - attribute'}, {'cui': 'C0441730', 'cui_str': 'Type 2'}]","[{'cui': 'C0037473', 'cui_str': 'Sodium'}, {'cui': 'C0017725', 'cui_str': 'Glucose'}, {'cui': 'C0598849', 'cui_str': 'Co-Transporters'}, {'cui': 'C0243077', 'cui_str': 'inhibitors'}, {'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}, {'cui': 'C0332287', 'cui_str': 'With'}, {'cui': 'C0021641', 'cui_str': 'Insulin'}, {'cui': 'C0013216', 'cui_str': 'Drug therapy'}, {'cui': 'C4301634', 'cui_str': 'Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors'}, {'cui': 'C0205195', 'cui_str': 'Combined'}, {'cui': 'C0061355', 'cui_str': 'Glucagon-like peptide 1'}, {'cui': 'C0243192', 'cui_str': 'agonists'}]","[{'cui': 'C0035647', 'cui_str': 'Risk of'}, {'cui': 'C2314882', 'cui_str': 'Genital Tract Infections'}, {'cui': 'C0428568', 'cui_str': 'Fasting blood glucose measurement'}, {'cui': 'C0019018', 'cui_str': 'Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated'}, {'cui': 'C0392756', 'cui_str': 'Reduced'}, {'cui': 'C0332173', 'cui_str': 'Daily'}, {'cui': 'C0178602', 'cui_str': 'Dosage'}, {'cui': 'C0021641', 'cui_str': 'Insulin'}, {'cui': 'C0005823', 'cui_str': 'Blood pressure'}, {'cui': 'C0018801', 'cui_str': 'Heart failure'}, {'cui': 'C0020616', 'cui_str': 'Hypoglycemic agent'}, {'cui': 'C0441471', 'cui_str': 'Event'}, {'cui': 'C0042029', 'cui_str': 'Urinary tract infectious disease'}, {'cui': 'C0005910', 'cui_str': 'Body weight'}, {'cui': 'C0007226', 'cui_str': 'Structure of cardiovascular system'}, {'cui': 'C1274040', 'cui_str': 'Result'}, {'cui': 'C1563740', 'cui_str': 'Abdominal Visceral Fat'}, {'cui': 'C0449468', 'cui_str': 'Volume'}, {'cui': 'C0262950', 'cui_str': 'Bone structure'}, {'cui': 'C0001688', 'cui_str': 'adverse effects'}, {'cui': 'C4524093', 'cui_str': 'Euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis'}, {'cui': 'C0546884', 'cui_str': 'Hypovolemia'}, {'cui': 'C0232823', 'cui_str': 'Osmotic diuresis'}, {'cui': 'C0021655', 'cui_str': 'Insulin resistance'}, {'cui': 'C0007613', 'cui_str': 'Physiology, Cell'}]",,0.0347668,"Although no difference has been found in the incidence of hypoglycemic events and urinary tract infection between the administration of this combination and that of placebo, the risk of genital tract infections was reported to increase with the combination therapy.","[{'ForeName': 'Yinqiu', 'Initials': 'Y', 'LastName': 'Yang', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Chenhe', 'Initials': 'C', 'LastName': 'Zhao', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Yangli', 'Initials': 'Y', 'LastName': 'Ye', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Mingxiang', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Yu', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Xinhua', 'Initials': 'X', 'LastName': 'Qu', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Bone and Joint Surgery, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.'}]",Frontiers in endocrinology,['10.3389/fendo.2020.00190']
529,32351609,Efficacy and Safety of Jueyin Granules for Patients with Mild-to-Moderate Psoriasis Vulgaris: Protocol for a Multicenter Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial.,"Introduction . The etiology and pathogenesis of psoriasis are complex. Blood-heat syndrome is the core pathogenesis of psoriasis. Based on theories of Chinese medicine (CM), heat-clearing and blood-cooling (HCBC) are the primary treatment. Very few studies have investigated the pharmacological mechanism of the CM HCBC method for treating psoriasis. This multicenter randomized controlled trial will focus on treating psoriasis blood-heat syndrome with the HCBC method using Jueyin granules (JYKL). This will be an objective and standardized evaluation of the efficacy, safety, and reproducibility of the HCBC method to obtain objective evidence meeting international standards that aim to establish a clinical standard suitable for the popular application of CM for treating psoriasis.  Methods and Analysis . A five-center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical design will be used in this study. At least 196 participants will be randomly assigned to receive either JYKL or placebo treatment approximately 30 minutes after meals in the morning and evening (one sachet per time, twice daily for 8 consecutive weeks). The study duration will be 17 weeks, including 1 week of screening, 8 weeks of intervention, and 8 weeks of follow-up. The patients will be evaluated every 2 weeks, and the measures will be compared with baseline values. The primary outcome measure will be the psoriasis lesion area severity index. We will also observe the recurrence rate, body surface area, physician global assessment, dermatology life quality index, quality of life index, visual analogue scale score, CM symptom score, combined drug use, and adverse events. This trial is registered with NCT03961230.",2020,"We will also observe the recurrence rate, body surface area, physician global assessment, dermatology life quality index, quality of life index,

530,32351642,Socially-Assistive Robots Using Empathy to Reduce Pain and Distress during Peripheral IV Placement in Children.,"Objectives


Socially-assistive robots (SAR) have been used to reduce pain and distress in children in medical settings. Patients who perceive empathic treatment have increased satisfaction and improved outcomes. We sought to determine if an empathic SAR could be developed and used to decrease pain and fear associated with peripheral IV placement in children.
Methods


We conducted a pilot study of children receiving IV placement. Participating children were randomized to interact with (1) no robot, or a commercially available 3D printed humanoid SAR robot programmed with (2) empathy or (3) distraction conditions. Children and parents completed demographic surveys, and children used an adapted validated questionnaire to rate the robot's empathy on an 8-point Likert scale. Survey scores were compared by the  t -test or chi-square test. Pain and fear were measured by self-report using the FACES and FEAR scales, and video tapes were coded using the CHEOPS and FLACC. Scores were compared using repeated measures 2-way ANOVA. This trial is registered with NCT02840942.
Results


Thirty-one children with an average age of 9.6 years completed the study. For all measures, mean pain and fear scores were lowest in the empathy group immediately before and after IV placement. Children were more likely to attribute characteristics of empathy to the empathic condition (Likert score 7.24  v . 4.70;  p =0.012) and to report that having the empathic vs. distraction robot made the IV hurt less (7.45 vs. 4.88;  p =0.026).
Conclusions

531,32351648,Effects of intracoronary injection of nicorandil and tirofiban on myocardial perfusion and short-term prognosis in elderly patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction after emergency PCI.,"BACKGROUND


This study investigated the effects of the intracoronary injection of nicorandil and tirofiban on myocardial perfusion and short-term prognosis in elderly patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
METHODS


Seventy-eight STEMI patients with age >65 years who underwent emergency PCI were consecutively enrolled. These patients received conventional PCI and were randomly divided into a control group and a treatment group ( n =39 per group). The control group received an intracoronary injection of tirofiban followed by a maintenance infusion for 36 hours after surgery. The treatment group received intracoronary injection of tirofiban and nicorandil, and then intravenous infusion of tirofiban and nicorandil 36 hours after surgery. The following parameters were measured: TIMI grade, corrected TIMI frame count (cTFC), TIMI myocardial perfusion grade (TMPG), ST-segment resolution (STR) rate 2 hours post-operatively, resolution of ST-segment elevation (STR) at 2 hours postoperatively, peak level of serum CK-MB, left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 7-10 days postoperatively, and major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) in-hospital and within 30 days post-operatively.
RESULTS


Compared with the control group, more patients in the treatment group had TIMI 3 and TMPG 3, and STR after PCI was significantly higher. The treatment group also had significantly lower cTFC, lower infarction relative artery (IRA), lower peak CK-MB, and no reflow ratio after PCI. The treatment group had significantly higher LVEDD and LVEF but lower incidence of MACEs than the control group.
CONCLUSION


The intracoronary injection of nicorandil combined with tirofiban can effectively improve myocardial reperfusion in elderly STEMI patients after emergency PCI and improve short-term prognoses.",2020,"The treatment group also had significantly lower cTFC, lower infarction relative artery (IRA), lower peak CK-MB, and no reflow ratio after PCI.","['elderly patients with acute

532,32351660,Effects of Cathode Direct-Current Electroacupuncture Stimulus of the Promixal Anterior Lower Limbs on Heart Rate and Lumbar Blood Flow.,"Objective:  There has been little research on direct-current acupuncture. This study was conducted to verify the effect of acupuncture current intensity and polarity on heart rate (HR) when applying direct-current electroacupuncture (DCEA) to the proximal anterior part of the lower limbs and to clarify the effect of cathodes (-) on lumbar blood flow.  Materials and Methods:  This study was conducted at Teikyo Heisei University, Chiba, Japan. The subjects were 144 healthy male volunteers (21.7 ± 0.6 years' old). These participants were divided into 1 control, 1 manual acupuncture (MA), and 3 DECEA groups (-25 μ A , +75 μ A , and -75 μ A ). Acupuncture was performed on the lower limbs (at ST 36), and HR and intertissue blood flow (ITBF) were observed as the main outcome measures.  Results:  For intensity, HR was significantly lower in the -75 μ A  group than in the control ( P  < 0.001), MA ( P  < 0.001), and -25 μ A  ( P  < 0.01) groups. For polarity, HR was significantly lower in the -75 μ A  group than in the +75 μ A  group ( P  = 0.0028). For blood flow, the volume of HbO 2  in the L-4-L-5 region at 1 minute after stimulation was significantly higher in the -75 μ A  stimulus group than in the MA group ( P  < 0.05). There was no change in the T-7-T-8 region.

533,32351735,"Efficacy of Simple Eye Ointment, Polyethylene Cover, and Eyelid Taping in Prevention of Ocular Surface Disorders in Critically Ill Patients: A Randomized Clinical Trial.","Background


Under normal conditions, the cornea of the eye is protected from bacterial invasion, physical injury, and drying by the presence of tears, eyelids, and blinking reflex. However, patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for several reasons including loss of consciousness, receiving sedative and neuromuscular blocking agents, and mechanical ventilation may lose eye-protective mechanisms causing exposure keratopathy. Therefore, this study intended to compare three eye care methods to prevent ocular surface disorders (OSDs) in ICU patients.
Methods


This study was a double-blind clinical trial (IRCT: 201109225426N3, https://www.irct.ir/trial/5825), in which 152 patients were randomized into three groups and each group underwent a different eye care procedure. The eye care methods included simple eye ointment, polyethylene cover, and eyelid taping. The eligible patients received the care procedure for seven days, and their corneas were examined daily for OSD by a portable slit lamp with fluorescein staining. Descriptive and analytical tests (ANOVA, chi-square, logistic regression, and zero-inflated Poisson regression) were used for statistical analysis by STATA14.
Results


The odds of OSD (chances of getting an OSD grade between I and VI) in the ointment group were 0.19 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.41), and the odds of OSD in the polyethylene cover group were 0.06 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.20), showing a significant difference with the tape group ( p =0.0001). Despite the lower odds of OSD in the cover group than in the ointment group, there was no significant between-group difference ( p =0.08). However, the mean OSD scores in both the ointment and polyethylene cover groups were significantly lower than that in the tape group.
Conclusion


The results of this study showed that polyethylene cover followed by simple eye ointment and eyelid taping were the most effective methods in preventing OSD. Therefore, polyethylene cover and simple eye ointment are recommended as effective eye care methods in ICU.",2020,"Despite the lower odds of OSD in the cover group than in the ointment group, there was no significant between-group difference ( p =0.08).","['Critically Ill Patients', '152 patients', 'ICU patients', 'patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for several reasons including loss of consciousness, receiving sedative and neuromuscular blocking agents, and']","['care procedure for seven days, and their corneas were examined daily for OSD by a portable slit lamp with fluorescein staining', 'mechanical ventilation', 'simple eye ointment, polyethylene cover, and eyelid taping', 'Simple Eye Ointment, Polyethylene Cover, and Eyelid Taping']","['odds of OSD (chances of getting an OSD grade', 'mean OSD scores', 'OSD', 'odds of OSD']","[{'cui': 'C0010340', 'cui_str': 'Critical illness'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0010337', 'cui_str': 'Care of intensive care unit patient'}, {'cui': 'C0184666', 'cui_str': 'Hospital admission'}, {'cui': 'C0021708', 'cui_str': 'Intensive care unit'}, {'cui': 'C0392360', 'cui_str': 'Indication of'}, {'cui': 'C0332257', 'cui_str': 'Including'}, {'cui': 'C0041657', 'cui_str': 'Loss of consciousness'}, {'cui': 'C0020592', 'cui_str': 'HYPNOTICS AND SEDATIVES'}, {'cui': 'C0027866', 'cui_str': 'Neuromuscular blocking agent'}]","[{'cui': 'C0025664', 'cui_str': 'methods'}, {'cui': 'C0205453', 'cui_str': '7'}, {'cui': 'C0332173', 'cui_str': 'Daily'}, {'cui': 'C0521125', 'cui_str': 'For'}, {'cui': 'C0183355', 'cui_str': 'Slit lamp biomicroscope'}, {'cui': 'C0332287', 'cui_str': 'With'}, {'cui': 'C0060520', 'cui_str': 'Fluorescein'}, {'cui': 'C0199470', 'cui_str': 'Mechanical ventilation'}, {'cui': 'C0205352', 'cui_str': 'Simple'}, {'cui': 'C0304651', 'cui_str': 'Eye ointment'}, {'cui': 'C0032487', 'cui_str': 'Polyethylenes'}, {'cui': 'C0439844', 'cui_str': 'Covered'}, {'cui': 'C0015426', 'cui_str': 'Eyelid structure'}]","[{'cui': 'C0004002', 'cui_str': 'Aspartate aminotransferase'}, {'cui': 'C0441800', 'cui_str': 'Grade'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0449820', 'cui_str': 'Score'}]",152.0,0.0775557,"Despite the lower odds of OSD in the cover group than in the ointment group, there was no significant between-group difference ( p =0.08).","[{'ForeName': 'Mehdi', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Ahmadinejad', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Faculty of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.'}, {'ForeName': 'Esmat', 'Initials': 'E', 'LastName': 'Karbasi', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.'}, {'ForeName': 'Yunes', 'Initials': 'Y', 'LastName': 'Jahani', 'Affiliation': 'Modeling in Health Research Center, Institute for Futures Studies in Health, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.'}, {'ForeName': 'Maryam', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Ahmadipour', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.'}, {'ForeName': 'Maryam', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Soltaninejad', 'Affiliation': 'Critical Care Nurse, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.'}, {'ForeName': 'Zahra', 'Initials': 'Z', 'LastName': 'Karzari', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Nursing, Midwifery and Health, Faculty of Nursing, Kerman Branch, Islamic Azad University, Kerman, Iran.'}]",Critical care research and practice,['10.1155/2020/6267432']
534,32351736,The Effect of Lymph Nodes' Histologic Response on Survival Outcomes in Moroccan Patients with Rectal Cancer.,"Prognosis for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to elucidate possible association between therapeutic effect on lymph nodes (LNs) and patient prognosis. Overall, 149 patients with rectal cancer received preoperative radiotherapy in concomitance with chemotherapy or exclusive radiotherapy before rectal excision. Microscopic examination of formalin-fixed lymph nodes was assessed for therapeutic effect. The establishment of groups combined reaction tissue types of fibrosis, colloid, and necrosis after neoadjuvant treatment was assigned. The average age was 56.38 years, ranged between 22 and 88 years, 53% were female, and 47% were men, with a sex ratio of 1 : 12. In the present study, we noticed that after a median follow-up time of 40.67 months (0-83; SD: 21.1), overall survival was statistically significant depending on age groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significant differences in the rate of patients with an age under 65 years (70.64%) versus those with an age over 85 years (36.5%) ( p  < 0.001). Also, the OS was statistically significant depending on therapeutic effect groups composed of 0TE (No Therapeutic effect), C+ (presence of only colloidal effect), F+ (presence of only fibrosis tissue), and ME+ (mixture of 2 or 3 types of therapeutic effect) group. Indeed, we observed a significantly higher OS rate in the ME + group (86%) compared with the OS rate of LNs group with no therapeutic effect (57%) ( p =0.028). Additionally, there was a significant association between the presence of fibrosis on LNs and an extended delay of more than 8 weeks to neoadjuvant treatment completion and surgery. Our study indicates that the best patient prognosis could be predicted based on tumor presenting a best pathologic effect on lymph nodes, and that delaying surgery for more than 8 weeks to neoadjuvant treatment completion improves therapeutic response on LNs.",2020,"Indeed, we observed a significantly higher OS rate in the ME + group (86%) compared with the OS rate of LNs group with no therapeutic effect (57%) ( p =0.028).","['patients with locally advanced rectal cancer', 'Moroccan Patients with Rectal Cancer', '149 patients with rectal cancer', 'The average age was 56.38 years, ranged between 22 and 88 years, 53% were female, and 47% were men, with a sex ratio of 1\u2009:\u200912']","['F', '0TE', 'preoperative radiotherapy in concomitance with chemotherapy or exclusive radiotherapy', ""Lymph Nodes' Histologic Response"", 'C']","['OS rate', 'overall survival', 'Survival Outcomes']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0007113', 'cui_str': 'Rectal cancer'}, {'cui': 'C5191071', 'cui_str': '149'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C3542016', 'cui_str': 'Concept model range'}, {'cui': 'C0043210', 'cui_str': 'Woman'}, {'cui': 'C0025266', 'cui_str': 'Man'}, {'cui': 'C0036893', 'cui_str': 'Sex Ratio'}]","[{'cui': 'C0445204', 'cui_str': 'Preoperative'}, {'cui': 'C0034619', 'cui_str': 'radiotherapy'}, {'cui': 'C0013216', 'cui_str': 'Drug therapy'}, {'cui': 'C0024204', 'cui_str': 'Structure of lymph node'}, {'cui': 'C0205462', 'cui_str': 'Histologic'}]","[{'cui': 'C0282416', 'cui_str': 'Overall'}, {'cui': 'C0038952', 'cui_str': 'Survival'}, {'cui': 'C1274040', 'cui_str': 'Result'}]",149.0,0.0607666,"Indeed, we observed a significantly higher OS rate in the ME + group (86%) compared with the OS rate of LNs group with no therapeutic effect (57%) ( p =0.028).","[{'ForeName': 'Ihsane', 'Initials': 'I', 'LastName': 'El Otmani', 'Affiliation': 'Laboratory of Biomedical and Translational Research.

Video feedback (VF) has previously shown promise, however, negative effects of VF-related anxiety on performance have been previously reported. Our aim was to investigate for a difference in participant anxiety between supervised individualised video feedback (SIVF) and unsupervised generic video feedback (UGVF) when undertaking simulated basic practical procedures. Methods Undergraduate medical students participating in a clinical skills study to compare UGVF and SIVF completed a Likert scale questionnaire detailing perceived anxiety. During the study, students were recorded performing three basic surgical skills (simple interrupted suturing, intravenous cannulation, urinary catheterisation). Feedback was then provided by one of two methods: (1) SIVF - participant video footage reviewed together with a tutor providing targeted feedback, and (2) UGVF - participant video footage reviewed alone with concurrent access to a generic pre-recorded 'expert tips' video clip for comparison. Each participant received SIVF and UGVF at least once. Results The majority of participants did not find either SIVF (81.7%) or UGVF (78.8%) stressful. Students had a strong preference for SIVF (77.5%) and disagreed that similar 'face-to-face' feedback had impaired learning in the past (80.3%).

536,32351966,Ketosis After Intake of Coconut Oil and Caprylic Acid-With and Without Glucose: A Cross-Over Study in Healthy Older Adults.,"Introduction:  Medium-chain-triglycerides (MCT), formed by fatty acids with a length of 6-12 carbon atoms (C6-C12), constitute about two thirds of coconut oil (Coc). MCT have specific metabolic properties which has led them to be described as ketogenic even in the absence of carbohydrate restriction. This effect has mainly been demonstrated for caprylic acid (C8), which constitutes about 6-8% of coconut oil. Our aim was to quantify ketosis and blood glucose after intake of Coc and C8, with and without glucose intake. Sunflower oil (Suf) was used as control, expected to not break fasting ketosis, nor induce supply-driven ketosis.  Method:  In a 6-arm cross-over design, 15 healthy volunteers-age 65-73, 53% women-were tested once a week. After a 12-h fast, ketones were measured during 4 h after intake of coffee with cream, in combination with each of the intervention arms in a randomized order: 1. Suf (30 g); 2. C8 (20 g) + Suf (10 g); 3. C8 (20 g) + Suf (10 g) + Glucose (50 g); 4. Coc (30 g); 5. Coc (30 g) + Glucose (50 g); 6. C8 (20 g) + Coc (30 g). The primary outcome was absolute blood levels of the ketone β-hydroxybutyrate, area under the curve (AUC). ANOVA for repeated measures was performed to compare arms.  Results:  β-hydroxybutyrate, AUC/time (mean ± SD), for arms were 1: 0.18 ± 0.11; 2: 0.45 ± 0.19; 3: 0.28 ± 0.12; 4: 0.22 ± 0.12; 5: 0.08 ± 0.04; 6: 0.45 ± 0.20 (mmol/L). Differences were significant (all  p  ≤ 0.02), except for arm 2 vs. 6, and 4 vs. 1 & 3. Blood glucose was stable in arm 1, 2, 4, & 6, at levels slightly below baseline ( p  ≤ 0.05) at all timepoints hours 1-4 after intake.  Conclusions:  C8 had a higher ketogenic effect than the other components. Coc was not significantly different from Suf, or C8 with glucose. In addition, we report that a 16-h non-carbohydrate window contributed to a mild ketosis, while blood glucose remained stable. Our results suggest that time-restricted feeding regarding carbohydrates may optimize ketosis from intake of MCT.

We describe the co-occurrence of daily smoking, binge drinking, and intimate partner violence (IPV) behaviors among Latino expectant fathers and examine factors associated with the co-occurrence of these behaviors. We conducted a secondary analysis of baseline data from the Parejas Trial, a randomized controlled trial testing a culturally tailored couples-based smoking cessation intervention. We used Kruskal-Wallis test statistics to explore the relationship of the co-occurring behavior and demographic and cultural factors. All participants smoked as was a requirement of being in the trial, but only 39% smoked daily. Forty three percent of the participants engaged in one behavior, 32% engaged in two behaviors, and 5% engaged in three behaviors, with binge drinking being the most common co-occurring behavior. In the bivariate analysis, higher stress (p = 0.01) and having more children (p = 0.003) were found to be positively significantly associated with the number of behaviors.

541,30696755,Reproducibility and Validity of the 6-Minute Stationary Walk Test Associated With Virtual Reality in Subjects With COPD.,"BACKGROUND


The importance of evaluating the functional capacity of patients with COPD is well known, and there is a wide range of tests described in the literature. The 6-min stationary walk test associated with virtual reality (STVR-6) was created in light of the current limitations of evaluation tests. It does not require a large physical space or sophisticated equipment, and it is not costly; furthermore, it can be performed by a single rater. The objective of this study was to evaluate intra- and inter-rater reproducibility and to verify the criterion validity of the STVR-6.
METHODS


50 subjects with COPD were evaluated over the course of 3 d. The execution order of the tests was randomized; the STVR-6 was performed over 2 d, and the 6-min walk test was performed in 1 d. The 6-min walk distance variables and number of steps in the STVR-6 were obtained with a gas analysis performed for both tests.
RESULTS


Relative reproducibility was found for intraclass correlation coefficient values (0.57-0.94,  P  < .001) between the number of steps and the highest value of oxygen consumption during the test (V̇ O 2  peak), intra- and inter-rater. In terms of absolute reproducibility, the standard error of measurement and minimum detectable difference values were verified. In the Bland-Altman analysis, the intra- and inter-rater mean difference values were 21 and 17 steps and 0.002 and 0.242 mL/min/kg, respectively. Pearson correlation values were 0.57-0.75 ( P  < .001) between the number of steps and V̇ O 2  peak.
CONCLUSIONS


STVR-6 had excellent intra-rater reproducibility and excellent to good inter-rater reproducibility, but the high values of error measures demonstrated that there is a learning effect and a need to perform at least 2 tests. In addition, there was high to moderate correlation between the STVR-6 and the 6-min walk test. Therefore, the STVR-6 proved to be reproducible and valid for evaluating the functional capacity of subjects with COPD.",2019,"RESULTS

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an irreversible disease characterized by cough, sputum production, and dyspnea, and has a high prevalence and mortality. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a management that improves the quality of life for COPD patients; however, PR is not readily accessible. Therefore, we developed lung-conduction exercises (LCE) that can be performed without any limitations. LCE consists of breathing, stretching, and tapping to relieve dyspnea in COPD patients.
METHODS/DESIGN


This randomized, assessor-blind, multicenter trial aims to recruit 54 patients with moderate and severe COPD. Subjects will be randomly allocated to a control group (only medication), an LCE group (medication + LCE, 5 times a week), or a PR group (medication + PR, 5 times a week). The 6-minute walk distance, pulmonary function tests (forced expiratory volume at 1 second, forced vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume at 1 second/forced vital capacity), modified Borg scale, modified medical research council dyspnea scale, COPD assessment test, and St. George respiratory questionnaire will be measured before starting the trial and after the 4th and 8th weeks to determine motor performance, lung function, and dyspnea.

Our study aimed to prospectively compare relapse rates between 12 months' and 18 months' consolidation periods to see whether or not there is beneficial durability of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) therapy with longer consolidation periods.We enrolled a total of 137 HBeAg-positive Asian CHB patients treated with TDF monotherapy. Forty-six patients achieved HBeAg SC. Then, they were randomly assigned to consolidation period of either 12 months (group A) or 18 months (group B). After stopping TDF therapy, all patients were followed up for 12 months.Thirteen patients (56.5%) relapsed in group A and 12 patients (52.2%) relapsed in group B after 12 months' follow-up (P = .958).

544,32358375,Computed tomography (CT) imaging evaluation of integrated traditional Chinese medicine cooperative therapy in treating acute cerebral infarction: A randomized controlled trial.,"INTRODUCTION


Acute cerebral infarction is a clinically common cerebrovascular disease. Acute cerebral infarction is characterized by sudden onset, dangerous illness, high risk of death, and disability. Computed tomography perfusion imaging can detect abnormal brain tissue perfusion 30 minutes after the onset of cerebral ischemia, providing the earliest and most valuable information for clinical diagnosis and treatment. In recent years, the effect of traditional Chinese medicine on acute cerebral infarction has been remarkable.
METHODS/DESIGN


This study plan randomly divided eligible acute cerebral infarction patients into two groups. Patients in the control group will be treated with conventional Western medicine; patients in the intervention group will be treated with traditional Chinese medicine cooperative therapy on the basis of conventional Western medicine. The curative effects will be selected before treatment, 2 weeks after treatment, and 3 months follow-up. The changes in CT imaging evaluation, NIHSS score, and BI index of the two groups of patients will be observed.
DISCUSSION


We aim to provide higher evidence-based medical evidence for traditional Chinese medicine treatment of acute cerebral infarction. And clarify the application value of computed tomography perfusion imaging in the diagnosis and efficacy evaluation of acute cerebral infarction.

545,32352832,Effects of 4-week mindfulness training versus adaptive cognitive training on processing speed and working memory in multiple sclerosis.,"OBJECTIVE


The aim of this preregistered, secondary analysis of a pilot randomized controlled trial (NCT02717429) was to compare the impact of 4-week mindfulness-based training and adaptive cognitive training, with a waitlist control condition, on processing speed and working memory in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS).
METHOD


Sixty-one PwMS were randomized to mindfulness-based training (MBT), adaptive computerized cognitive training (aCT), or a waitlist (WL) control group and completed the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological Tests at pre- and posttraining. Training-related changes on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) were the primary outcomes of interest. Baseline cognitive status was examined as a moderator of treatment gains. Practice time, change in aCT game difficulty, and rate of change in state awareness across MBT were assessed as correlates of cognitive gains.
FINDINGS


Compared with aCT and WL, mindfulness training significantly improved processing speed (η p ² = .14). Baseline cognitive status did not moderate change in processing speed (η p ² = .005) or working memory (η p ² = .014). Practice time and change in game difficulty were not significantly correlated with cognitive gains (all  p s > .49). In the MBT group, rate of change in awareness was significantly associated with improvement in working memory (ρ = .52,  p  = .04).
CONCLUSIONS

547,32352903,Evaluation of Serratus Anterior Plane Block for Pain Relief in Patients Undergoing MIDCAB Surgery.,"OBJECTIVE


The minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) surgery is associated with severe chest pain in the first 2 to 3 postoperative days; this may delay the patient recovery. In this randomized controlled trial we evaluated the role of serratus anterior plane (SAP) block for postoperative pain relief in patients undergoing MIDCAB surgery.
METHODS


Patients undergoing MIDCAB surgery were randomized into 2 groups of 25 each; SAP group received 20 mL of 0.2% ropivacaine with 1 μg/mL fentanyl as bolus followed by infusion at 8 mL/h; control group received saline for both bolus and infusion. Primary outcome measure was postoperative pain when supine, and during deep inspiration, coughing, and patient movement; secondary outcome measures were requirement of postoperative intravenous fentanyl and opioid-related side effects. All patients were followed at 6-hourly intervals for 48 hours in the postoperative period. Results were analyzed by the Student's  t  -test,  χ   2  test, Mann-Whitney  U -test and Kruskall-Wallis test. A  P -value <0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS


The 2 groups were similar with respect to patient characteristics. Static and dynamic pain visual analog scale scores were significantly reduced in the SAP group as compared to the control group at most of the time points of assessment ( P  < 0.05). Patient-controlled fentanyl requirements were reduced in the SAP group as compared to control group on the second postoperative day ( P  < 0.05).

548,32352912,A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial of a Lay Health Worker Intervention to Increase Healthy Eating and Physical Activity Among Vietnamese Americans.,"INTRODUCTION


Americans have low levels of knowledge of and adherence to recommendations for healthy eating of fruits and vegetables and for physical activity (HEPA). We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial of a lay health worker intervention to increase HEPA among Vietnamese Americans.
METHODS


We randomized 64 lay health workers to 2 intervention arms. Each lay health worker recruited 10 participants aged 50 to 74. From 2008 to 2013, using flip charts, lay health workers led 2 educational sessions on HEPA (intervention) or colorectal cancer (comparison). We assessed HEPA knowledge and self-reported behaviors by preintervention and postintervention surveys 6 months apart.
RESULTS


Of the 640 participants, 50.0% were female, 38.4% had lived in the United States for 10 years or fewer, and 71.4% reported limited English proficiency. Knowledge of the recommended intake of fruits and vegetables (≥5 servings daily) increased from 2.6% to 60.5% in the intervention group (n = 311) and from 2.9% to 6.7% in the comparison group (n = 316) (intervention vs comparison change, P < .001). Knowledge of the physical activity recommendation (≥150 minutes weekly) increased from 2.6% to 62.4% among intervention participants and from 1.0% to 2.5% among comparison participants (P < .001). Consumption of 5 or more daily servings of fruits and vegetables increased more in the intervention group (8.4% to 62.1%) than in the comparison group (5.1% to 12.7%) (P < .001). Participants reporting 150 minutes or more of physical activity weekly increased from 28.9% to 54.0% in the intervention group and from 38.0% to 46.8% in the comparison group (intervention vs comparison change, P = .001).

549,32353101,The influence of a doppler ultrasound in arteriovenous fistula for dialysis failure related to some risk factors.,"INTRODUCTION


The increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease has increased the demand for arteriovenous fistula (AVF) care. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between some risk factors for AVF failure (advanced age, female sex, diabetes, obesity, central venous catheter, previous fistula, and hospitalization) and having a Doppler ultrasound performed preoperatively.
METHODS


A prospective study was performed with 228 dialysis patients from Imperatriz, Maranhão. Half of the sample was randomly selected to receive preoperative Doppler ultrasound and the other half did not, from the period of October 2016 to September 2018.
RESULTS


There were 53 total failures corresponding to 23.2% of our sample, which is almost double that of the patients in the clinical group. Considering the failures and risk factors associated with the overall sample, there was a statistically significant association between a central venous catheter on the same side of the AVF with P = 0.04 (Odds Ratio 1.24) and obesity with P = 0.05 (Odds Ratio 1.36), which was not repeated in the Doppler ultrasound group individually. There was no statistically significant difference between the Doppler group and clinical group with respect to the amount of days of previous AVF hospitalization and failure.
CONCLUSIONS


We concluded that the reduction of failures with an introduction of the Doppler was statistically significant in the overall sample, but establishing a relationship between specific risk factors and failure was only possible with two of the risk factors in the study - obesity and central venous catheter on the same side of the AVF.",2020,"There was no statistically significant difference between the Doppler group and clinical group with respect to the amount of days of previous AVF hospitalization and failure.

Hypoglycemia attenuates cardiovascular homeostatic autonomic control. This attenuation, known as the cardiovascular component of hypoglycemia associated autonomic failure (HAAF) is characterized most notably by decreased baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) that begins during hypoglycemia and persists until at least the next day, despite return to euglycemia. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this reduction in BRS is important since BRS attenuation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.
OBJECTIVE


Investigate the role of the adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH)-adrenal axis in decreasing BRS. We tested the hypothesis that infusion of ACTH 1-24 (cosyntropin), as compared to placebo, would acutely suppress BRS, and that this decrease in BRS would be present the next day.
DESIGN


Double-blind, placebo-controlled, random-order, cross-over study.
SETTING


Clinical research center.
PARTICIPANTS


Healthy men and women.
INTERVENTIONS


Intravenous infusion of cosyntropin (70 mcg/hour for 2.5 hours in the morning and again in the early afternoon) versus normal saline placebo.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES


BRS during and 16 hours after cosyntropin versus placebo infusions.
RESULTS


Cosyntropin infusion attenuated BRS (mmHg/ms) as compared to placebo (baseline 17.8±1.38 vs.17.0±2.07; during 14.4±1.43 vs. 17.3±1.65; and next day 14.8±1.42 vs. 18.9±2.04; p<0.05, time by treatment, ANOVA). BRS was decreased during the final 30 minutes of the AM cosyntropin infusion as compared to baseline (p<0.01) and remained suppressed the next day (16 hours after PM infusion) (p<0.025). Placebo infusion did not significantly change BRS. QTc was not affected.
CONCLUSIONS


ACTH attenuates BRS, raising the possibility that hypoglycemia-induced increases in ACTH may contribute to the cardiovascular component of HAAF.",2020,"QTc was not affected.

The safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of a novel mGlu 2/3  receptor agonist prodrug, MGS0274 besylate (TS-134), were investigated in healthy subjects.
METHODS


Phase 1 single-ascending dose (SAD; 5-20 mg) and multiple-ascending dose titration (MAD; 5-80 mg) studies were conducted in healthy male and female subjects. Both studies were randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled. In one cohort of SAD study (10 mg), concentrations of MGS0008, the active compound, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured for up to 24 h post-dose.
RESULTS


Following single and multiple oral administrations, MGS0274 was rapidly absorbed and extensively converted into MGS0008, which reached a maximum concentration (C max  ) in plasma within 4 h post-dose and declined with a terminal half-life (t 1/2  ) of around 10 h. Plasma exposure to MGS0274 was minimal, accounting for approximately 3% of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of MGS0008. Plasma C max  and AUC of MGS0008 at steady state increased dose proportionally (5-80 mg). MGS0008 penetrated into CSF, with a CSF-to-plasma C max  ratio of 3.66%, and was eliminated with a t 1/2  of approximately 16 h. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events observed following single and multiple oral administration included headache, nausea, somnolence, dizziness and vomiting.
CONCLUSIONS


TS-134 is orally bioavailable in humans and converts rapidly and extensively to MGS0008, which exhibits good CSF penetration. Orally administered TS-134 was safe and generally well-tolerated; hence, TS-134 is a promising candidate for further clinical development for the treatment of disorders in which glutamatergic abnormalities are involved, such as schizophrenia.",2020,Plasma C max  and AUC of MGS0008 at steady state increased dose proportionally (5-80 mg).,"['healthy male and female subjects', 'healthy subjects', 'Healthy Subjects']","['TS-134', 'novel mGlu 2/3  receptor agonist prodrug, MGS0274 besylate (TS-134', 'MGS0274 Besylate (TS-134', 'single-ascending dose (SAD; 5-20 mg) and multiple-ascending dose titration (MAD', 'placebo']","['Plasma C max  and AUC of MGS0008', 'maximum concentration (C max  ) in plasma', 'headache, nausea, somnolence, dizziness and vomiting']","[{'cui': 'C0086582', 'cui_str': 'Male'}, {'cui': 'C0043210', 'cui_str': 'Woman'}, {'cui': 'C1708335', 'cui_str': 'Healthy Participants'}]","[{'cui': 'C4517565', 'cui_str': '134'}, {'cui': 'C0205314', 'cui_str': 'New'}, {'cui': 'C2987634', 'cui_str': 'Receptor agonist'}, {'cui': 'C0033262', 'cui_str': 'Drug Precursors'}, {'cui': 'C0037179', 'cui_str': 'Single person'}, {'cui': 'C0205385', 'cui_str': 'Ascending'}, {'cui': 'C0178602', 'cui_str': 'Dosage'}, {'cui': 'C0439064', 'cui_str': 'Numerous'}, {'cui': 'C0162621', 'cui_str': 'Titration method'}, {'cui': 'C0032042', 'cui_str': 'Sham Treatment'}]","[{'cui': 'C0032105', 'cui_str': 'blood plasma'}, {'cui': 'C0127092', 'cui_str': 'Max protein'}, {'cui': 'C0376690', 'cui_str': 'Area under the curve'}, {'cui': 'C0963196', 'cui_str': 'MGS 0008'}, {'cui': 'C0806909', 'cui_str': 'Max'}, {'cui': 'C0004268', 'cui_str': 'Attention'}, {'cui': 'C0018681', 'cui_str': 'Headache'}, {'cui': 'C0027497', 'cui_str': 'Nausea'}, {'cui': 'C0013144', 'cui_str': 'Drowsiness'}, {'cui': 'C0012833', 'cui_str': 'Dizziness'}, {'cui': 'C0042963', 'cui_str': 'Vomiting'}]",,0.0852044,Plasma C max  and AUC of MGS0008 at steady state increased dose proportionally (5-80 mg).,"[{'ForeName': 'Mai', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Watanabe', 'Affiliation': 'Taisho Pharmaceutical R&D Inc., NJ, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Brian', 'Initials': 'B', 'LastName': 'Marcy', 'Affiliation': 'Taisho Pharmaceutical R&D Inc., NJ, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kohnosuke', 'Initials': 'K', 'LastName': 'Kinoshita', 'Affiliation': 'Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Misako', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Fukasawa', 'Affiliation': 'Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Hirohiko', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Hikichi', 'Affiliation': 'Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Shigeyuki', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Chaki', 'Affiliation': 'Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Shigeru', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Okuyama', 'Affiliation': 'Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'ForeName': 'Hakop', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Gevorkyan', 'Affiliation': 'California Clinical Trials Medical Group, CA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Shigeru', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Yoshida', 'Affiliation': 'Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.'}]",British journal of clinical pharmacology,['10.1111/bcp.14331']
552,32353277,"Multisystemic therapy versus management as usual in the treatment of adolescent antisocial behaviour (START): 5-year follow-up of a pragmatic, randomised, controlled, superiority trial.","BACKGROUND


Multisystemic therapy is a manualised treatment programme for young people aged 11-17 years who exhibit antisocial behaviour. To our knowledge, the Systemic Therapy for At Risk Teens (START) trial is the first large-scale randomised controlled trial of multisystemic therapy in the UK. Previous findings reported to 18 months after baseline (START-I study) did not indicate superiority of multisystemic therapy compared with management as usual. Here, we report outcomes of the trial to 60 months (START-II study).
METHODS


In this pragmatic, randomised, controlled, superiority trial, young people (aged 11-17 years) with moderate-to-severe antisocial behaviour were recruited from social services, youth offending teams, schools, child and adolescent mental health services, and voluntary services across England, UK. Participants were eligible if they had at least three severity criteria indicating past difficulties across several settings and one of five general inclusion criteria for antisocial behaviour. Eligible families were randomly assigned (1:1), using stochastic minimisation and stratifying for treatment centre, sex, age at enrolment, and age at onset of antisocial behaviour, to management as usual or 3-5 months of multisystemic therapy followed by management as usual. Research assistants and investigators were masked to treatment allocation; the participants could not be masked. For this extension study, the primary outcome was the proportion of participants with offences with convictions in each group at 60 months after randomisation. This study is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN77132214, and is closed to accrual.
FINDINGS


Between Feb 4, 2010, and Sept 1, 2012, 1076 young people and families were assessed for eligibility and 684 were randomly assigned to management as usual (n=342) or multisystemic therapy (n=342). By 60 months' of follow-up, 188 (55%) of 342 people in the multisystemic therapy group had at least one offence with a criminal conviction, compared with 180 (53%) of 341 in the management-as-usual group (odds ratio 1·13, 95% CI 0·82-1·56; p=0·44).
INTERPRETATION


The results of the 5-year follow-up show no evidence of longer-term superiority for multisystemic therapy compared with management as usual.

553,32353342,"Abemaciclib plus trastuzumab with or without fulvestrant versus trastuzumab plus standard-of-care chemotherapy in women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive advanced breast cancer (monarcHER): a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial.","BACKGROUND


Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more previous therapies for advanced disease have few effective treatment options. The monarcHER trial aimed to compare the efficacy of abemaciclib plus trastuzumab with or without fulvestrant with standard-of-care chemotherapy of physician's choice plus trastuzumab in women with advanced breast cancer.
METHODS


This phase 2, three-group, open-label trial was done across 75 hospitals, clinics, and medical centres in 14 countries. Eligible patients were women aged 18 years or older, who had hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive advanced breast cancer with unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and who had previously received at least two HER2-targeted therapies for advanced disease. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to the abemaciclib, trastuzumab, and fulvestrant (group A), abemaciclib and trastuzumab (group B), or standard-of-care chemotherapy and trastuzumab (group C). Oral abemaciclib 150 mg 12 hourly was administered on days 1-21 of a 21-day cycle, intravenous trastuzumab 8 mg/kg on cycle 1 day 1, followed by 6 mg/kg on day 1 of each subsequent 21-day cycle, and intramuscular fulvestrant 500 mg on days 1, 15, and 29 and once every 4 weeks thereafter. Standard-of-care chemotherapy was administered as specified by the product label. Randomisation was by a computer-generated random sequence by means of an interactive web-response system and stratified by number of previous systemic therapies for advanced breast cancer and measurable versus non-measurable disease. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population, first testing group A versus group C and, if this result was significant, then group B versus group C. Safety was assessed in all patients who had received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02675231) and is ongoing for long-term survival follow-up.
FINDINGS


Between May 31, 2016, and Feb 28, 2018, 325 patients were screened, of whom 237 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to groups A (n=79), B (n=79), and C (n=79). Median follow-up was 19·0 months (IQR 14·7-25·1). The study met its primary endpoint, showing a significant difference at the prespecified two-sided α of 0·2 in median progression-free survival between group A (8·3 months, 95% CI 5·9-12·6) and group C (5·7 months, 5·4-7·0; HR 0·67 [95% CI 0·45-1·00]; p=0·051). No difference was observed between median progression-free survival in group B (5·7 months, 95% CI 4·2-7·2) and group C (HR 0·94 [0·64-1·38]; p=0·77). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse event in groups A, B, and C was neutropenia (21 [27%] of 78 patients, 17 [22%] of 77, and 19 [26%] of 72). The most common serious adverse events were: in group A, pyrexia (three [4%]), diarrhoea (two [3%]), urinary tract infection (two [3%]), and acute kidney injury (two [3%]); in group B, diarrhoea (two [3%]) and pneumonitis (two [3%]); and in group C, neutropenia (four [6%]) and pleural effusion (two [3%]). Two deaths were attributed to treatment: one due to pulmonary fibrosis in group B and one due to febrile neutropenia in group C.
INTERPRETATION


The combination of abemaciclib, fulvestrant, and trastuzumab significantly improved progression-free survival versus standard-of-care chemotherapy plus trastuzumab while showing a tolerable safety profile. Our results suggest that a chemotherapy-free regimen might potentially be an alternative treatment option for patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.

554,32353418,Fluid Response Evaluation in Sepsis Hypotension and Shock: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"BACKGROUND


Fluid and vasopressor management in septic shock remains controversial. In this randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the efficacy of dynamic measures (stroke volume change during passive leg raise) to guide resuscitation and improve patient outcome.
RESEARCH QUESTION


Will resuscitation guided by dynamic assessments of fluid responsiveness in patients with septic shock improve patient outcomes?
STUDY DESIGN


and Methods: Prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial at 13 hospitals in the United States and United Kingdom. Patients presented to Emergency Rooms with sepsis associated hypotension and anticipated Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. Intervention arm patients were assessed for fluid responsiveness before clinically driven fluid bolus or increase in vasopressors. The protocol included reassessment and therapy as indicated by the PLR result. The control arm received Usual Care. Primary clinical outcome was positive fluid balance at 72 hours or ICU discharge, whichever occurred first.
RESULTS


In modified-ITT (mITT) analysis including 83 Intervention and 41 Usual Care eligible patients, fluid balance at 72 hours or ICU discharge was significantly lower (-1.37L favoring Intervention arm, 0.65 ± 2.85L Intervention arm vs. 2.02 ± 3.44L Usual Care arm, p=0.021. Fewer patients required renal replacement therapy (5.1% vs 17.5%, p=0.04) or mechanical ventilation (17.7% vs 34.1%, p=0.04) in the Intervention arm compared to Usual Care. In the all-randomized Intent to Treat (ITT) population (102 Intervention, 48 Usual Care) there were no significant differences in safety signals.
INTERPRETATION

A significant subset of breast cancer survivors experience cognitive difficulties in attention and memory, which persist for years following treatment. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to be effective in improving working memory, attention, processing speed, and other cognitive functions in both healthy and clinical populations. To date, no studies have examined tDCS in rehabilitation of cancer-related cognitive dysfunction.
OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS


We aimed to provide preliminary evidence for feasibility, tolerability, acceptability, and efficacy of tDCS in improving performance on a measure of sustained attention.
METHODS


In a within-subjects design, 16 breast cancer survivors underwent 2 consecutive days of active tDCS over the prefrontal cortex, and 2 days of sham tDCS, counterbalanced for order of stimulation condition, while performing a continuous performance test.
RESULTS


Stimulation was feasible and tolerable, with 89% of participants completing all sessions, and none reporting more than mild to moderate discomfort. Analyses of efficacy showed that during active stimulation, participants had significantly lower standard errors of reaction times overall, indicating better sustained attention ability, as compared to sham stimulation (p<0.05). Furthermore, the effect of stimulation on standard errors of reaction times differed by inter-stimulus interval (ISI): for 1 and 2 second ISIs, there was no significant difference in performance between sham and active tDCS conditions, but for 4 second ISIs, stimulation improved variability in response times relative to sham (p<0.05).

556,32353592,A randomized controlled noninferiority trial comparing radiofrequency with stripping and CHIVA technique for insufficiency of the great saphenous vein.,"OBJECTIVE


The quality of available evidence regarding new minimally invasive techniques to abolish great saphenous vein reflux is moderate. This study aimed to assess whether radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was noninferior to each of the stripping (HL/S) and CHIVA methods on clinical and ultrasound recurrence at 2 years in patients with primary varicose veins (VV) due to great saphenous vein (GSV) insufficiency.
METHODS


A randomized, single-centre, open-label, controlled, noninferiority trial comparing RFA with two surgical techniques for the treatment of primary VV due to GSV insufficiency. The noninferiority margin was set at 15% for absolute differences. Patients aged over 18 years with primary VV and GSV incompetence, with or without clinical symptoms, C2 - C6 clinical class of CEAP and GSV diameter >4 mm were randomized with a 1:1:1 ratio to RFA, HL/S or CHIVA. Rate of clinical recurrence at 24 months was the primary endpoint and was analyzed using a delta noninferiority margin of 15%. Ultrasound recurrence, safety and quality of life were considered as secondary endpoints for descriptive purposes.
RESULTS


From December 2012 to June 2015, 225 limbs were randomized to RFA, HL/S or CHIVA (74/75/76). Clinical follow-up and Doppler Ultrasound (DUS) were performed after surgery at 1 week, 1, 6, 12 and 24 months. No differences in postoperative complications or pain were observed between groups. RFA was found to be noninferior to HL/S on clinical recurrence at 24 months, with an estimated difference in recurrence (95% CI) of 3% (-4.8%, 10.7%), noninferiority P= 0.002, and noninferior to CHIVA (95% CI) of -7% ( -17%, 3%) P<0.001. For ultrasound recurrence, RFA was found to be noninferior to CHIVA with an estimated difference (95% CI) of -34% (-47, -20) noninferiority P<0.001 at 24 months, but noninferiority could not be demonstrated compared to HL/S (5.9% 95% CI -4.1, 15.9) P=0.073. There were no differences in quality of life between groups.

557,32353619,Suture Tape Reduces Quadriceps Tendon Repair Gap Formation Compared to High Strength Suture: A Cadaveric Biomechanical Analysis.,"PURPOSE


The purpose of this study was to compare the biomechanical differences between quadriceps tendon (QT) repair with high-strength suture (HSS) versus suture tape (ST) with varying number of suture passes.
METHODS


28 fresh-frozen QTs were randomized into two groups: i) HSS; or ii) ST; specimens were then further randomized into subgroups of either four or six suture passes. Specimens were secured within a materials testing system and a 150 N preload was applied 10s followed by a cyclic loading protocol between 50N and 250N for 1000 cycles. Video was utilized to follow tracking markers used to calculate the magnitude of tendon displacement. Two-way univariate ANOVA was used to determine the effect of suture type and passes on the displacement after preloading and mixed repeated-measures ANOVA was used to determine the effect of suture type and passes on displacement following cyclic loading.
RESULTS


There were large increases in displacement following the preload across all conditions (7.82±3.64 mm), with no statistically significant differences between groups. There was a significant difference in the mean (±SD) displacement between the ST (5.24±2.82 mm) and HSS (7.93±2.91 mm) starting at 200 cycles, which became more pronounced with successive testing out to 1000 cycles (p=0.0≤21). There were no significant difference with respect to the number of suture or tape passes.results CONCLUSIONS: Following preloading at 150N, significant displacement occurred in both quadriceps tendon repair groups. ST demonstrated significantly less displacement than HSS under cyclic loading and had greater ultimate failure loads.conclusion CLINICAL RELEVANCE: When performing quadriceps tendon repair, emphasis should be placed on appropriate pre-tensioning of sutures to at least 150N prior to knot-tying. Additionally, where available, suture tape should be utilized over high-strength suture to reduce further cyclic elongation and improve ultimate failure loads.",2020,ST demonstrated significantly less displacement than HSS under cyclic loading and had greater ultimate failure loads.conclusion,['28 fresh-frozen QTs'],"['quadriceps tendon (QT) repair with high-strength suture (HSS) versus suture tape (ST', 'HSS; or ii) ST', 'High Strength Suture', 'Suture Tape']","['number of suture or tape passes.results', 'Quadriceps Tendon Repair Gap Formation', 'ultimate failure loads.conclusion', 'mean (±SD) displacement']","[{'cui': 'C0443224', 'cui_str': 'Fresh'}, {'cui': 'C0016701', 'cui_str': 'Freezing'}]","[{'cui': 'C0224941', 'cui_str': 'Structure of quadriceps tendon'}, {'cui': 'C0043240', 'cui_str': 'Tissue repair'}, {'cui': 'C0205250', 'cui_str': 'High'}, {'cui': 'C0009068', 'cui_str': 'Closure by suture'}, {'cui': 'C0343138', 'cui_str': 'Strapping procedure'}]","[{'cui': 'C0457280', 'cui_str': 'Number of sutures'}, {'cui': 'C0343138', 'cui_str': 'Strapping procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0547072', 'cui_str': 'Repair of quadriceps'}, {'cui': 'C0061928', 'cui_str': 'GTPase-Activating Protein'}, {'cui': 'C0220781', 'cui_str': 'Anabolism'}, {'cui': 'C0231174', 'cui_str': 'Failure'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0012725', 'cui_str': 'Displacement - mental defense mechanism'}]",,0.0324435,ST demonstrated significantly less displacement than HSS under cyclic loading and had greater ultimate failure loads.conclusion,"[{'ForeName': 'Philip P', 'Initials': 'PP', 'LastName': 'Roessler', 'Affiliation': '- Fowler Kennedy Sports Medicine Clinic, 3M Center, Western University 1151 Richmond Street London ON, Canada N6A 3K7.'}, {'ForeName': 'Timothy A', 'Initials': 'TA', 'LastName': 'Burkhart', 'Affiliation': '- Research Scientist/Adjunct Professor, Lawson Health Research Institute Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Western University London, ON, Canada.'}, {'ForeName': 'Lan', 'Initials': 'L', 'LastName': 'Getgood', 'Affiliation': '- Fowler Kennedy Sports Medicine Clinic, 3M Center, Western University 1151 Richmond Street London ON, Canada N6A 3K7.'}, {'ForeName': 'Ryan M', 'Initials': 'RM', 'LastName': 'Degen', 'Affiliation': '- Fowler Kennedy Sports Medicine Clinic, 3M Center, Western University 1151 Richmond Street London ON, Canada N6A 3K7.

559,32353816,Effects of a Mindfulness-based Intervention on diurnal cortisol pattern in disadvantaged families: A randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE


The present study examined the psychophysiological effects of Family-based Mindfulness Intervention (FBMI) on children and parents from disadvantaged families.
METHODS


This randomized controlled trial recruited parents and their children from 51 disadvantaged families in Hong Kong and randomized them into FBMI (n = 26) and waitlist control (n = 25) groups. The parent intervention included 6 sessions and the child intervention included 8 sessions with 2 half-hour joint programs. Both interventions lasted 9 hours in total each. All participants completed four salivary cortisol measures after wakeup, before lunchtime, late-afternoon, and before sleep at baseline and end of the intervention. The diurnal cortisol pattern was summarized by the morning cortisol, evening cortisol, mean cortisol, and diurnal cortisol slope.
RESULTS


Compared to the control group, children in the FBMI group showed significant increases in morning cortisol (d = 0.50, p =  0.03) and significant decreases in diurnal cortisol slopes (d = 0.50, p =  0.04) at the end of intervention. Parents in the FBMI group displayed significant decreases in evening cortisol (d = 0.50, p =  0.04) compared to the control group at the end of intervention. No significant treatment effects were found on the mean cortisol.

560,32353822,Effects of sugammadex on postoperative respiratory management in children with congenital heart disease: a randomized controlled study.,"BACKGROUND


Early extubation can reduce pulmonary complications in children undergoing cardiac surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of sugammadex for postoperative respiratory management in children with congenital heart disease.
METHODS


Sixty children with congenital heart disease undergoing elective cardiac surgery were divided into group S and group C (30 children in each group). When post tetanic twitches count (PTC) = 1-2 and train-of-four (TOF) = 0, the children in group S received sugammadex4 mg/kg for reversal of neuromuscular block at the end of surgery, and the children in group C received the same volume of normal saline. The recovery time to TOF of 0.9, the mechanical ventilation and extubation times were recorded. On the other side, the hemodynamic parameters before and 5 min after administration, and side effects were also recorded. The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) before and 24 h after surgery were measured.
RESULTS


The recovery time to TOF of 0.9 and extubation time were significantly shorter in the group S than in the group C (4.2 ± 1.4 vs 108.2 ± 26.7 min, 66.3 ± 6.5 vs 171.6 ± 23.1 min, respectively, P <  0.01). The CRP and PCT levels were found to be increased in both groups at postoperative 24 h than before surgery. Further, the levels of PCT and CRP at postoperative 24 h were lower in group S when compared to group C (median, 7 vs 17.5 mg/ml, 1.76 vs 5.22 ng/ml, respectively, P <  0.05). There were no statistical differences observed between the two groups (P> 0.05) with respect to side effects.
CONCLUSION


Sugammadex is rapid and effective in reversing rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block, and significantly reduces the extubation time and the release of postoperative CRP and PCT in children with congenital heart diseases.",2020,"The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) before and 24 h after surgery were measured.

561,32353830,Implications of maraviroc and/or rapamycin in a mouse model of fragility.,"BACKGROUND


As age increases, the risk of developing fragility also increases. Improving the knowledge of frailty could contribute to maintaining the functional ability of elderly people. Interleukin (IL)-10 homozygous knockout mice (IL-10 tm/tm  [IL10KO]) constitute an excellent tool for the study of frailty. Because patients with frailty demonstrate an overexpression of CCR5, rapamycin (RAPA) and/or maraviroc (MVC), two molecules able to decrease CCR5 expression, were evaluated.
RESULTS


Muscle myostatin was reduced in all the therapeutic groups but the MVC group (p <0.001 for RAPA and MVC-RAPA) and in serum samples (p <0.01 for all the groups). Serum CK levels were also significantly lower in MVC and RAPA groups (p <0.01 in both cases). Lower AST levels were observed in all the therapeutic groups (p <0.05 for all of them). The apoptotic effector caspase-3 was significantly lower in MVC and RAPA groups (p<0.05 in both cases). Combined treatment with MVC-RAPA showed a synergistic increase in p-AKT, p-mTOR and SIRT1 levels.
CONCLUSIONS


MVC and RAPA show a protective role in some factors involved in frailty. More studies are needed to prove their clinical applications.
MATERIAL AND METHODS


Eighty male homozygous IL10KOs were randomly assigned to one of 4 groups (n= 20): i) IL10KO group (IL10KO); ii) IL10KO receiving MVC in drinking water (MVC group), iii) IL10KO receiving RAPA in drinking water (RAPA group), and finally, iv) MVC-RAPA group that received MVC and RAPA in drinking water.

The present study investigates the wellbeing effects for 10-12-year-old children of the school-based intervention ""11 for Health in Denmark"", which comprises physical activity (PA) and health education. Subgroup analyses were carried out for boys and girls.
METHOD


3061 children were randomly assigned to an intervention group (IG) or a control group (CG) by 5:1 cluster randomisation by school. 2533 children (mean age 11.5±0.4; 49.7% boys) were assigned to IG and 528 children (mean age 11.4±0.5; 50.8% boys) were assigned to CG. IG participated in the ""11 for Health in Denmark"" 11-week programme, consisting of 2x45 min per week of football drills, small-sided games and health education. CG did not participate in any intervention and continued with their regular education. Before and after the intervention period, both groups answered a shortened version of the multidimensional well-being questionnaire KIDSCREEN-27.
RESULTS


The ""11 for Health in Denmark"" intervention programme had a positive effect on physical well-being in girls (IG: 48.6±8.5 to 50.2±9.3), whereas the improvement was not significant in boys. The programme also had positive impact on well-being score for peers and social support (IG: 50.2±10.2 to 50.8±10.1), but when analysed separately in the subgroups of boys and girls the changes were not significant.

563,32358640,"Probiotic Administration Increases Amino Acid Absorption from Plant Protein: a Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Double-Blind, Multicenter, Crossover Study.","The fate of dietary protein in the gut is determined by microbial and host digestion and utilization. Fermentation of proteins generates bioactive molecules that have wide-ranging health effects on the host. The type of protein can affect amino acid absorption, with animal proteins generally being more efficiently absorbed compared with plant proteins. In contrast to animal proteins, most plant proteins, such as pea protein, are incomplete proteins. Pea protein is low in methionine and contains lower amounts of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), which play a crucial role in muscle health. We hypothesized that probiotic supplementation results in favorable changes in the gut microbiota, aiding the absorption of amino acids from plant proteins by the host. Fifteen physically active men (24.2 ± 5.0 years; 85.3 ± 12.9 kg; 178.0 ± 7.6 cm; 16.7 ± 5.8% body fat) co-ingested 20 g of pea protein with either AminoAlta™, a multi-strain probiotic (5 billion CFU L. paracasei LP-DG® (CNCM I-1572) plus 5 billion CFU L. paracasei LPC-S01 (DSM 26760), SOFAR S.p.A., Italy) or a placebo for 2 weeks in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, separated by a 4-week washout period. Blood samples were taken at baseline and at 30-, 60-, 120-, and 180-min post-ingestion and analyzed for amino acid content.

564,32358661,Comparison of the short-term results of single-dose intra-articular peptide with hyaluronic acid and platelet-rich plasma injections in knee osteoarthritis: a randomized study.,"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES


Intra-articular injections may be useful in terms of pain and functional status, in knee osteoarthritis (OA). Besides hyaluronic acid (HA) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP), peptide molecules recently begin to be used. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of intra-articular peptide Prostrolane® (CAREGEN Co. Ltd.) injection with that of the HA and PRP in the persons with OA.
METHOD


Fifty-four patients with OA were included in this prospective, randomized study. Patients were randomized into three groups as intra-articular HA, peptide, and PRP groups. Paracetamol was permitted three times a day to all groups. All the patients were evaluated by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and visual analogue scale (VAS) at rest and during movements. Measurements performed at the baseline, after the first week of injection, and at the first and third months of follow-up.
RESULTS


Mean age was 55.8 ± 8.9 years. Forty-four (81.6%) were women. A week after the injections, rest and movement pain severity was measured by VAS decreased significantly in all the study groups (p < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of first week pain relief (p > 0.05). WOMAC pain, stiffness, function, and total scores were improved significantly in all the groups a week after the injections (p < 0.05). Improvement continued at the third month control; however, the improvement in the WOMAC pain score was significantly better in the peptide group at the third month control (p < 0.05). The decrease in the rest and movement pain was continued for 3 months except the HA group's rest pain. There were no differences among the groups for all measurements, except for the WOMAC pain score at 3 months after treatment, which was significantly lower in the peptide group.
CONCLUSION


As a result, pain relief and functional improvement were obtained after the intra-articular HA, peptide, and PRP injections in OA, and decrease in pain was better in the peptide group.Key Points• The short-term effects of intra-articular HA, peptide, and PRP injections were compared in knee osteoarthritis.• HA, peptide, and PRP injections may be useful in pain relief and functional improvement in knee osteoarthritis.",2020,"There were no differences among the groups for all measurements, except for the WOMAC pain score at 3 months after treatment, which was significantly lower in the peptide group.

566,32358769,The effects of vagus nerve stimulation on the course and outcomes of patients with bipolar disorder in a treatment-resistant depressive episode: a 5-year prospective registry.,"BACKGROUND


To compare illness characteristics, treatment history, response and durability, and suicidality scores over a 5-year period in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression participating in a prospective, multicenter, open-label registry and receiving Vagus Nerve Stimulation Therapy (VNS Therapy) plus treatment-as-usual (VNS + TAU) or TAU alone.
METHODS


Response was defined as ≥ 50% decrease from baseline Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at 3, 6, 9, or 12 months post-baseline. Response was retained while MADRS score remained ≥ 40% lower than baseline. Time-to-events was estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis and compared using log-rank test. Suicidality was assessed using the MADRS Item 10 score.
RESULTS


At baseline (entry into registry), the VNS + TAU group (N = 97) had more episodes of depression, psychiatric hospitalizations, lifetime suicide attempts and higher suicidality score, more severe symptoms (based on MADRS and other scales), and higher rate of prior electroconvulsive therapy than TAU group (N = 59). Lifetime use of medications was similar between the groups (a mean of 9) and was consistent with the severe treatment-resistant nature of their depression. Over 5 years, 63% (61/97) in VNS + TAU had an initial response compared with 39% (23/59) in TAU. The time-to-initial response was significantly quicker for VNS + TAU than for TAU (p < 0.03). Among responders in the first year after implant, the KM estimate of the median time-to-relapse from initial response was 15.2 vs 7.6 months for VNS + TAU compared with TAU (difference was not statistically significant). The mean reduction in suicidality score across the study visits was significantly greater in the VNS + TAU than in the TAU group (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS


The patients who received VNS + TAU included in this analysis had severe bipolar depression that had proved extremely difficult to treat. The TAU comparator group were similar though had slightly less severe illnesses on some measures and had less history of suicide attempts. Treatment with VNS + TAU was associated with a higher likelihood of attaining a response compared to TAU alone. VNS + TAU was also associated with a significantly greater mean reduction in suicidality.
LIMITATIONS


In this registry study, participants were not randomized to the study treatment group, VNS Therapy stimulation parameters were not controlled, and there was a high attrition rate over 5 years.

567,32358917,Circulating biomarkers and cardiac function over 3 years after chemotherapy with anthracyclines: the ICOS-ONE trial.,"AIMS


A multicentre trial, ICOS-ONE, showed increases above the upper limit of normality of cardiac troponin (cTn) in 27% of patients within 12 months after the end of cancer chemotherapy (CT) with anthracyclines, whether cardiac protection with enalapril was started at study entry in all (prevention arm) or only upon first occurrence on supra-normal cTn (troponin-triggered arm). The aims of the present post hoc analysis were (i) to assess whether anthracycline-based treatment could induce cardiotoxicity over 36 month follow-up and (ii) to describe the time course of three cardiovascular biomarkers (i.e. troponin I cTnI-Ultra, B-type natriuretic peptide BNP, and pentraxin 3 PTX3) and of left ventricular (LV) function up to 36 months.
METHODS AND RESULTS


Eligible patients were those prescribed first-in-life CT, without evidence of cardiovascular disease, normal cTn, LV ejection fraction (EF) >50%, not on renin-angiotensin aldosterone system antagonists. Patients underwent echocardiography and blood sampling at 24 and 36 months. No differences were observed in biomarker concentration between the two study arms, 'prevention' vs. 'troponin-triggered'. During additional follow-up 13 more deaths occurred, leading to a total of 23 (9.5%), all due to a non-cardiovascular cause. No new occurrences of LV-dysfunction were reported. Two additional patients were admitted to the hospital for cardiovascular causes, both for acute pulmonary embolism. No first onset of raised cTnI-Ultra was reported in the extended follow-up. BNP remained within normal range: at 36 months was 23.4 ng/L, higher (N.S.) than at baseline, 17.6 ng/L. PTX3 peaked at 5.2 ng/mL 1 month after CT and returned to baseline values thereafter. cTnI-Ultra peaked at 26 ng/L 1 month after CT and returned to 3 ng/L until the last measurement at 36 months. All echocardiographic variables remained stable during follow-up with a median LVEF of 63% and left atrial volume index about 24 mL/m 2  .
CONCLUSIONS

568,32359018,Efficacy of microneedling versus fractional Er:YAG laser in facial rejuvenation.,"BACKGROUND


Microneedling and fractional lasers have been used in facial rejuvenation with acceptable results and low adverse effects.
AIMS


To compare the efficacy of microneedling with fractional Er:YAG in facial skin rejuvenation.
PATIENTS/METHODS


This study was planned as a split-face clinical trial. Volunteers were randomly allocated to receive three monthly treatments on each side of the face, one with fractional Er:YAG laser and one with microneedling. The assessments included investigating clinical outcomes by two blinded dermatologists accompanied by measuring skin biophysical characteristics including cutaneous resonance running time (CRRT) and transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Moreover, possible adverse effects, downtime, and patients' satisfaction were recorded at baseline, 1 month after each treatment, and 3 months after the last treatment session. The protocol was approved by the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT20160820029436N3).
RESULTS


Of the 32 selected volunteers, 24 subjects completed the study. The clinical assessment showed a significant improvement of the face appearance along with a significant reduction in dyschromia, and periorbital wrinkling (P-value < .05), with both procedures without any considerable difference between two methods. Moreover, the patients showed substantial satisfaction with both modalities with no statistically significant difference. Mean TEWL and CRRT values also decreased significantly in both groups with no considerable difference. The downtime was significantly shorter in the microneedling-treated side. There were no long-lasting or severe adverse effects after treatment with both methods.
CONCLUSION


Microneedling and fractional Er:YAG laser have comparable efficacy in facial rejuvenation, but little downtime of the former makes it preferable for many patients.",2020,Mean TEWL and CRRT values also decreased significantly in both groups with no considerable difference.,"['24 subjects completed the study', '32 selected volunteers', 'facial rejuvenation']","['fractional Er:YAG laser and one with microneedling', 'microneedling versus fractional Er:YAG laser', 'microneedling with fractional Er:YAG']","[""adverse effects, downtime, and patients' satisfaction"", 'downtime', 'skin biophysical characteristics including cutaneous resonance running time (CRRT) and transepidermal water loss (TEWL', 'dyschromia, and periorbital wrinkling (P-value', 'Microneedling and fractional', 'long-lasting or severe adverse effects', 'Mean TEWL and CRRT values']","[{'cui': 'C0205197', 'cui_str': 'Complete'}, {'cui': 'C0008972', 'cui_str': 'Clinical Study'}, {'cui': 'C0042960', 'cui_str': 'Voluntary worker'}, {'cui': 'C0015450', 'cui_str': 'Face structure'}, {'cui': 'C0035016', 'cui_str': 'Rejuvenation'}]","[{'cui': 'C0457903', 'cui_str': 'Erbium:YAG laser device'}]","[{'cui': 'C0001688', 'cui_str': 'adverse effects'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0242428', 'cui_str': 'Satisfaction'}, {'cui': 'C0444099', 'cui_str': 'Specimen from skin'}, {'cui': 'C0005553', 'cui_str': 'Biophysics'}, {'cui': 'C0332257', 'cui_str': 'Including'}, {'cui': 'C1522447', 'cui_str': 'Cutaneous route'}, {'cui': 'C0231881', 'cui_str': 'Resonance'}, {'cui': 'C0035953', 'cui_str': 'Running'}, {'cui': 'C0040223', 'cui_str': 'Time'}, {'cui': 'C0020311', 'cui_str': 'Hydrotherapy'}, {'cui': 'C0151907', 'cui_str': 'Discoloration of skin'}, {'cui': 'C0230064', 'cui_str': 'Periorbital'}, {'cui': 'C1273875', 'cui_str': 'Values (community)'}, {'cui': 'C0205166', 'cui_str': 'Long'}, {'cui': 'C0205082', 'cui_str': 'Severe'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0011991', 'cui_str': 'Diarrhea'}]",32.0,0.0858563,Mean TEWL and CRRT values also decreased significantly in both groups with no considerable difference.,"[{'ForeName': 'Reza M', 'Initials': 'RM', 'LastName': 'Robati', 'Affiliation': 'Skin Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'ForeName': 'Behnaz', 'Initials': 'B', 'LastName': 'Hamedani', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, Loghman Hakim Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'ForeName': 'Nastaran', 'Initials': 'N', 'LastName': 'Namazi', 'Affiliation': 'Skin Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'ForeName': 'Nasim', 'Initials': 'N', 'LastName': 'Niknejad', 'Affiliation': 'Skin Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'ForeName': 'Mehdi', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Gheisari', 'Affiliation': 'Skin Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}]",Journal of cosmetic dermatology,['10.1111/jocd.13440']
569,32359021,Novel yeast extract is superior to colloidal oatmeal in providing rapid itch relief.,"BACKGROUND


Approximately, 13.5% of the population suffers from chronic itch. Many cosmetic and pharmaceutical treatments for itch are available; however, cosmetic treatments are not reliably effective and most pharmaceutical formulations carry the risk of adverse events with chronic use.
AIMS


Previously, we have reported a novel extraction process of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, that is, Baker's yeast. The extract obtained from the novel process demonstrates superior anti-itch properties compared to other yeast extracts. In our previous study, we demonstrated that, after 30 minutes, the extract significantly reduced itch when compared to a placebo lotion (P = .002).
METHODS


In the present study we conducted a head-to-head comparison with the leading cosmetic itch product: lotion containing colloidal oatmeal (CO). A randomized double-blinded study of 60 patients was conducted.
RESULTS


In our study, the novel yeast extract was vastly superior to the CO containing lotion (Aveeno™ Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream). We saw statistically significant difference in the reduction of itch (P = .0001) using the novel yeast extract vs the CO lotion. Additionally, the yeast extract was shown to relieve itch in as little as one minute after application.

570,32359042,"Efficacy of the eCHECKUP TO GO for High School Seniors: Sex Differences in Risk Factors, Protective Behavioral Strategies, and Alcohol Use.","OBJECTIVE


The purpose of this randomized controlled study was to examine sex as a moderator of the efficacy of a brief, web-based personalized feedback intervention (eCHECKUP TO GO) on decreasing cognitive risk factors for alcohol use, increasing protective behavioral strategies, and reducing alcohol use among high school seniors.
METHOD


Participants (n = 311) were high school seniors randomized by class period to the eCHECKUP TO GO intervention or assessment-only control group. Participants completed online surveys at baseline and 30-day follow-up (91.0%; n = 283).
RESULTS


Students in the intervention group reported a significant reduction in normative perceptions of peer drinking, positive alcohol expectancies, and alcohol use relative to those in the control group. Intervention effects for perceptions of frequency of peer drunkenness and frequency of alcohol use were moderated by sex, with results favoring females. In contrast, we did not find evidence for sex as a moderator of intervention effects for normative perceptions of peer drinking frequency, sex-specific perceptions of peer heavy episodic drinking, positive alcohol expectancies, or peak drinking quantity. Further, we did not find significant intervention or moderator effects for protective behavioral strategies.
CONCLUSIONS


Results of this study extend the literature by demonstrating the efficacy of the eCHECKUP TO GO for both males and females on reducing cognitive risk factors and alcohol use, although results were significant for a broader range of variables for females. Results also indicate that program content regarding normative feedback and protective behavioral strategies may need modification to be more effective for this age group.",2020,"In contrast, we did not find evidence for sex as a moderator of intervention effects for normative perceptions of peer drinking frequency, sex-specific perceptions of peer heavy episodic drinking, positive alcohol expectancies, or peak drinking quantity.","['High School Seniors', 'Participants (n = 311) were high school seniors randomized by class period to the', 'high school seniors']","['eCHECKUP TO GO intervention or assessment-only control group', 'web-based personalized feedback intervention (eCHECKUP TO GO', 'eCHECKUP TO GO']","['normative perceptions of peer drinking, positive alcohol expectancies, and alcohol use relative']","[{'cui': 'C0205250', 'cui_str': 'High'}, {'cui': 'C0036375', 'cui_str': 'School'}, {'cui': 'C0456387', 'cui_str': 'Class'}]","[{'cui': 'C0184661', 'cui_str': 'Procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0031809', 'cui_str': 'Physical examination'}, {'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}, {'cui': 'C0282111', 'cui_str': 'World Wide Web'}, {'cui': 'C0002055', 'cui_str': 'Alkali'}, {'cui': 'C0015744', 'cui_str': 'Feedback'}]","[{'cui': 'C0030971', 'cui_str': 'Perception'}, {'cui': 'C0001948', 'cui_str': 'Alcohol intake'}, {'cui': 'C1446409', 'cui_str': 'Positive'}, {'cui': 'C0001962', 'cui_str': 'Ethanol'}, {'cui': 'C0679138', 'cui_str': 'Expectations'}, {'cui': 'C0080103', 'cui_str': 'Relative'}]",311.0,0.0172365,"In contrast, we did not find evidence for sex as a moderator of intervention effects for normative perceptions of peer drinking frequency, sex-specific perceptions of peer heavy episodic drinking, positive alcohol expectancies, or peak drinking quantity.","[{'ForeName': 'Diana M', 'Initials': 'DM', 'LastName': 'Doumas', 'Affiliation': 'Institute for the Study of Behavioral Health and Addiction, Boise State University, Boise, Idaho.'}, {'ForeName': 'Susan', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Esp', 'Affiliation': 'Institute for the Study of Behavioral Health and Addiction, Boise State University, Boise, Idaho.'}, {'ForeName': 'Rob', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Turrisi', 'Affiliation': 'Biobehavioral Health and Prevention Research Center, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania.'}, {'ForeName': 'Laura', 'Initials': 'L', 'LastName': 'Bond', 'Affiliation': 'Biomolecular Research Center, Boise State University, Boise, Idaho.'}, {'ForeName': 'Brian', 'Initials': 'B', 'LastName': 'Flay', 'Affiliation': 'Initiative for Healthy Schools, Boise State University, Boise, Idaho.'}]",Journal of studies on alcohol and drugs,[]
571,32378654,A Comparison of the Weight Loss Effect between a Low-carbohydrate Diet and a Calorie-restricted Diet in Combination with Intragastric Balloon Therapy.,"Objective Intragastric balloon (IGB) therapy is a low-invasion treatment for obesity. Recently, a low-carbohydrate diet has shown effectiveness for encouraging weight loss, but whether or not a low-carbohydrate diet improves the efficacy of IGB therapy remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the effectiveness of a low-carbohydrate diet compared with a calorie-restricted diet in combination with IGB therapy. Methods A prospective study was conducted on 51 patients who had undergone IGB therapy from October 2012 to December 2017. Overall, 31 of the 51 patients were included in this study (12-month assessment after IGB placement). These 31 cases consisted of 18 IGB plus low-carbohydrate diet and 13 IGB plus calorie-restricted diet. We compared the two groups with respect to body weight loss as outcomes.

572,30277538,N2M2 (NOA-20) phase I/II trial of molecularly matched targeted therapies plus radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed non-MGMT hypermethylated glioblastoma.,"Background


Patients with glioblastoma without O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter hypermethylation are unlikely to benefit from alkylating chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ). Trials aiming at replacing TMZ with targeted agents in unselected patient populations have failed to demonstrate any improvement of survival. Advances in molecular understanding and diagnostic precision enable identification of key genetic alterations in a timely manner and in principle allow treatments with targeted compounds based on molecular markers.
Methods


The NCT Neuro Master Match (N2M2) trial is an open-label, multicenter, phase I/IIa umbrella trial for patients with newly diagnosed isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wildtype glioblastoma without MGMT promoter hypermethylation to show safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of treatment with targeted compounds in addition to standard radiotherapy based on molecular characterization. N2M2 is formally divided into a Discovery and a Treatment part. Discovery includes broad molecular neuropathological diagnostics to detect predefined biomarkers for targeted treatments. Molecular diagnostics and bioinformatic evaluation are performed within 4 weeks, allowing a timely initiation of postoperative treatment. Stratification for Treatment takes place in 5 subtrials, including alectinib, idasanutlin, palbociclib, vismodegib, and temsirolimus as targeted therapies, according to the best matching molecular alteration. Patients without matching alterations are randomized between subtrials without strong biomarkers using atezolizumab and asinercept (APG101) and the standard of care, TMZ. For the phase I parts, a Bayesian criterion is used for continuous monitoring of toxicity. In the phase II trials, progression-free survival at 6 months is used as endpoint for efficacy.

573,30311348,"Relationship between long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake and ankle brachial index, pulse wave velocity and resting heart rate in a sample of overweight adults: A secondary analysis of baseline data in the HealthTrack study.","AIM


The present study aimed to explore the association between dietary long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCn3PUFA) intake and cardiovascular risk indicators (ankle brachial index, resting heart rate and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity) in a clinical sample of overweight and obese participants volunteering for a weight loss trial.
METHODS


This was a secondary analysis of baseline data from the HealthTrack study (n = 351). LCn3PUFA intake was calculated via a diet history and the association with ankle brachial index, resting heart rate and brachio-ankle pulse wave velocity was explored using linear regression after controlling for covariates.
RESULTS


LCn3PUFA intake was inversely associated with ankle brachial index (R 2  change = 0.021, F change (1, 339) = 8.864, P < 0.05) and resting heart rate (R 2  change = 0.014, F change (1, 342) = 5.337, P < 0.05) but not with brachio-ankle pulse wave velocity (R 2  change = 0.001, F change (1, 339) = 0.725, P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS


In this clinical sample of overweight adults, LCn3PUFA consumption was significantly associated with a lower resting heart rate, adding to the current evidence on the potential benefits of LCn3PUFA consumption. It also supports the value of targeting a diet rich in this nutrient when planning future dietetic approaches. Relationships with ankle brachial index and pulse wave velocity require further investigation. Future research should assess the effect of changes in dietary LCn3PUFA intake on novel cardiovascular risk indicators.",2019,"RESULTS

574,30758745,Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison of Blinatumomab vs. Inotuzumab Ozogamicin for Adults with Relapsed/Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,"INTRODUCTION


In the absence of head-to-head trials, this analysis aimed to provide a fair indirect comparison of the efficacy between blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO), two treatments for adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R ALL) who received no more than one prior salvage therapy, by adjusting for cross-trial differences.
METHODS


Patient-level data from the Phase 3 blinatumomab trial TOWER and published aggregated data from the Phase 3 InO trial INO-VATE-ALL were used to conduct matching-adjusted indirect comparisons. Patients with 2+ prior salvage therapies from TOWER were excluded because such patients were not included in INO-VATE-ALL. To ensure balance in the remaining patients, baseline characteristics for the TOWER patients were weighted to match the average baseline characteristics in INO-VATE-ALL, including sex, age, race, performance status, bone marrow blast, previous salvage therapy, previous allogeneic transplantation, complete remission with complete hematologic recovery (CR) to most recent induction therapy, and duration of first remission. Overall survival (OS), including median and restricted mean survival time (RMST) at 12 and 20.7 months, and CR were estimated and compared.
RESULTS


A total of 310 patients in TOWER were included (blinatumomab, n = 203; standard of care chemotherapy, n = 107). After matching the listed baseline characteristics, the median OS was 9.3 months for blinatumomab and 7.7 months for InO (weighted log-rank test p = 0.4). The relative RMST at 12 months was 1.6 months longer for blinatumomab than for InO [95% CI (0.1, 3.2); p = 0.04]; at 20.7 months the RMST was not significantly different. The CR rates were similar [anchor-based difference = - 2.8%, 95% CI (- 17.5%, 11.9%); p = 0.71].
CONCLUSIONS


After adjusting for cross-trial differences, blinatumomab demonstrated a similar CR rate and potential OS benefit versus InO among adult patients with R/R ALL who received no more than one prior salvage therapy. Further studies are suggested to confirm this finding.

After a median patient follow-up of more than 108 months, we performed an intent-to-treat analysis of our 83 participants. Progression-free survival (PFS) rates at 108 months for follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) were 71%, 67% and 15%, respectively, and were affected by clinicopathological characteristics. Ten-year PFS rates for those with beta-2-microglobulin levels <2·2 and ≥2·2 mg/l prior to treatment were 71% and 21%, respectively. Patients without bone marrow involvement had 10-year PFS rates of 72% vs. 29% for those with involvement. At time of analysis, the median overall survival (OS) had not been reached.

576,32357109,Text Message Intervention for Teens with Type 1 Diabetes Preserves HbA1c: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Aims : Teens with type 1 diabetes (T1D) often struggle with diabetes self-management, which may lead to suboptimal self-care and worsening hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Innovative strategies are needed to improve self-care and protect against glycemic decline, especially during adolescence. We aimed to assess the impact on HbA1c of two interventions, problem-solving and text messaging, in teens with T1D.  Methods : In a two-site randomized controlled trial, teens ( N  = 301) 13-17 years of age with T1D were randomized to one of the four groups using a 2 × 2 factorial design: Teenwork (TW), Text Messaging (Text), TW+Text, or Usual Care. TW intervention included problem-solving aimed at improving T1D self-care for blood glucose (BG) monitoring and insulin bolus dosing. Text intervention involved text reminders to check BG. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c from baseline to 12 months.  Results : At baseline, teens (51% female, 78% white, 59% pump-treated) were (mean ± SD) 15.0 ± 1.3 years, had diabetes duration of 6.5 ± 3.7 years, and HbA1c 8.5% ± 1.1%. There was no significant difference in HbA1c over time by study group. Responsiveness to text reminders by teens in the TEXT and TW+TEXT predicted glycemic benefit; TW did not.  Conclusions : Despite no HbA1c difference by study group, greater response to text message reminders to check BG led to better glycemic control and no deterioration in HbA1c; the problem-solving intervention did not. Given the high penetration of mobile phones and the wide acceptance of text messaging among teens in general, it is encouraging that a text messaging intervention can preserve HbA1c, thus preventing the expected deterioration in glycemic control often seen in teens with T1D.",2020,Responsiveness to text reminders by teens in the TEXT and TW+TEXT,"['Aims : Teens with type 1 diabetes (T1D) often struggle with diabetes self-management, which may lead to suboptimal self-care and worsening hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c', 'teens with T1D.

577,32357128,Clinical and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Telerehabilitation for People With Nonspecific Chronic Low Back Pain.,"BACKGROUND


Telerehabilitation can facilitate multidisciplinary management for people with nonspecific chronic low back pain (NCLBP). It provides access to health care to individuals who are physically and economically disadvantaged.
OBJECTIVE


This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of a telerehabilitation compared with clinic-based intervention for people with NCLBP in Nigeria.
METHODS


A cost-utility analysis alongside a randomized controlled trial from a health care perspective was conducted. Patients with NCLBP were assigned to either telerehabilitation-based McKenzie therapy (TBMT) or clinic-based McKenzie therapy (CBMT). Interventions were carried out three times weekly for a period of 8 weeks. Patients' level of disability was measured using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at baseline, week 4, and week 8. To estimate the health-related quality of life of the patients, the ODI was mapped to short form six dimensions to generate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Health care resource use and costs were assessed based on the McKenzie extension protocol in Nigeria in 2019. Descriptive and inferential data analyses were also performed to assess the clinical effectiveness of the interventions. Bootstrapping technique was conducted to generate the point estimate of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).
RESULTS


A total of 47 patients (TBMT, n=21 and CBMT, n=26) with a mean age of 47 (SD 11.6) years for telerehabilitation and 50 (SD 10.7) years for clinic-based intervention participated in this study. The mean costs estimate of TBMT and CBMT interventions per person were 22,200 naira (US $61.7) and 38,200 naira (US $106), respectively. QALY gained was 0.085 for the TBMT and 0.084 for the CBMT. The TBMT arm was associated with an additional 0.001 QALY (95% CI 0.001 to 0.002) per participant compared with the CBMT arm. Thus, the ICER showed that TBMT arm was less costly and more effective than CBMT.
CONCLUSIONS


The findings of the study suggested that telerehabilitation for people with NCLBP was cost saving. Given the small number of participants in this study, further examination of effects and costs of the interventions are needed within a larger sample size. In addition, future studies are required to assess the cost effectiveness of this intervention in the long term from the patient and societal perspective.",2020,The TBMT arm was associated with an additional 0.001 QALY (95% CI 0.001 to 0.002) per participant compared with the CBMT arm.,"['individuals who are physically and economically disadvantaged', 'Patients with NCLBP', 'People With Nonspecific Chronic Low Back Pain', '47 patients (TBMT, n=21 and CBMT, n=26) with a mean age of 47 (SD 11.6) years for telerehabilitation and 50 (SD 10.7) years for clinic-based intervention participated in this study', 'people with nonspecific chronic low back pain (NCLBP', 'people with NCLBP in Nigeria']","['TBMT', 'telerehabilitation compared with clinic-based intervention', 'telerehabilitation-based McKenzie therapy (TBMT) or clinic-based McKenzie therapy (CBMT']","['Oswestry Disability Index (ODI', 'level of disability', 'incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER', 'mean costs estimate of TBMT']","[{'cui': 'C0027361', 'cui_str': 'Person'}, {'cui': 'C0013556', 'cui_str': 'Economics'}, {'cui': 'C0012613', 'cui_str': 'Disadvantaged'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0457949', 'cui_str': 'Chronic low back pain'}, {'cui': 'C4042802', 'cui_str': 'Remote Rehabilitation'}, {'cui': 'C0002055', 'cui_str': 'Alkali'}, {'cui': 'C0013216', 'cui_str': 'Drug therapy'}, {'cui': 'C0002424', 'cui_str': 'Ambulatory care site'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C4708782', 'cui_str': '11.6'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C5191365', 'cui_str': '10.7'}, {'cui': 'C0184661', 'cui_str': 'Procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0008972', 'cui_str': 'Clinical Study'}, {'cui': 'C0028075', 'cui_str': 'Nigeria'}]","[{'cui': 'C4042802', 'cui_str': 'Remote Rehabilitation'}, {'cui': 'C0002055', 'cui_str': 'Alkali'}, {'cui': 'C0013216', 'cui_str': 'Drug therapy'}, {'cui': 'C0002424', 'cui_str': 'Ambulatory care site'}, {'cui': 'C0184661', 'cui_str': 'Procedure'}]","[{'cui': 'C0451360', 'cui_str': 'Oswestry disability index'}, {'cui': 'C0441889', 'cui_str': 'Levels'}, {'cui': 'C0231170', 'cui_str': 'Disability'}, {'cui': 'C0010181', 'cui_str': 'Cost Effectiveness'}, {'cui': 'C0456603', 'cui_str': 'Ratio'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0010186', 'cui_str': 'Cost'}, {'cui': 'C0750572', 'cui_str': 'Estimated'}, {'cui': 'C4042802', 'cui_str': 'Remote Rehabilitation'}, {'cui': 'C0002055', 'cui_str': 'Alkali'}, {'cui': 'C0013216', 'cui_str': 'Drug therapy'}]",47.0,0.12828,The TBMT arm was associated with an additional 0.001 QALY (95% CI 0.001 to 0.002) per participant compared with the CBMT arm.,"[{'ForeName': 'Francis', 'Initials': 'F', 'LastName': 'Fatoye', 'Affiliation': 'Manchester Metropolitan University, Faculty of Health, Psychology and Social Care Manchester Metropolitan UniversityBirley Fields Campus Bonsall Street, Manchester, GB.'}, {'ForeName': 'Tadesse', 'Initials': 'T', 'LastName': 'Gebrye', 'Affiliation': 'Manchester Metropolitan University, Faculty of Health, Psychology and Social Care Manchester Metropolitan UniversityBirley Fields Campus Bonsall Street, Manchester, GB.'}, {'ForeName': 'Clara', 'Initials': 'C', 'LastName': 'Fatoye', 'Affiliation': 'Manchester Metropolitan University, Faculty of Health, Psychology and Social Care Manchester Metropolitan UniversityBirley Fields Campus Bonsall Street, Manchester, GB.'}, {'ForeName': 'Chidozie E', 'Initials': 'CE', 'LastName': 'Mbada', 'Affiliation': 'College of Health Sciences, Obafemi Awolowo University, Osun, NG.'}, {'ForeName': 'Mistura I', 'Initials': 'MI', 'LastName': 'Olaoye', 'Affiliation': 'College of Health Sciences, Obafemi Awolowo University, Osun, NG.'}, {'ForeName': 'Adesola C', 'Initials': 'AC', 'LastName': 'Odole', 'Affiliation': 'College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Oyo, NG.'}, {'ForeName': 'Olumide', 'Initials': 'O', 'LastName': 'Dada', 'Affiliation': 'College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Oyo, NG.'}]",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,['10.2196/15375']
578,32357152,Effects of antenatal hypnosis on maternal salivary cortisol during childbirth and six weeks postpartum-A randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND


Cortisol has been used to capture psychophysiological stress during childbirth and postpartum wellbeing. We explored the effect of a brief antenatal training course in self-hypnosis on salivary cortisol during childbirth and 6 weeks postpartum.
METHODS


In a randomized, controlled trial conducted at Aarhus University Hospital Skejby Denmark during the period January 2010 until October 2010, a total of 349 healthy nulliparous women were included. They were randomly allocated to a hypnosis group (n = 136) receiving three one-hour lessons in self-hypnosis with additional audio-recordings, a relaxation group (n = 134) receiving three one-hour lessons in various relaxation methods with audio-recordings for additional training, and a usual care group (n = 79) receiving ordinary antenatal care only. Salivary cortisol samples were collected during childbirth (at the beginning of the pushing state, 30 minutes, and 2 hours after childbirth), and 6 weeks postpartum (at wake up, 30 minutes after wake up, and evening). Cortisol concentrations were compared using a linear mixed-effects model. Correlations between cortisol concentrations and length of birth, experienced pain and calmness during birth were examined by a Spearman rank correlation test.
FINDINGS


During childbirth, week correlations were found between cortisol concentrations 30 minutes after childbirth and length of birth. In the beginning of the pushing state and 2 hours after childbirth, we found a tendency towards higher cortisol concentrations in the hypnosis group compared to the other two groups (hypnosis versus relaxation p = 0.02 and 0.03, hypnosis versus usual care p = 0.08 and 0.05). No differences were observed in cortisol concentrations between the groups 30 minutes after childbirth (hypnosis versus relaxation p = 0.08, hypnosis versus usual care 0.10) or 6 weeks postpartum (hypnosis versus relaxation: p = 0.85, 0.51, and 0.68, hypnosis versus usual care: p = 0.85, 0.93, and 0.96).
CONCLUSION


Antenatal hypnosis training may increase the release of cortisol during childbirth with no long-term consequences. Further research is needed to help interpret these findings.",2020,"No differences were observed in cortisol concentrations between the groups 30 minutes after childbirth (hypnosis versus relaxation p = 0.08, hypnosis versus usual care 0.10) or 6 weeks postpartum (hypnosis versus relaxation: p = 0.85, 0.51, and 0.68, hypnosis versus usual care: p = 0.85, 0.93, and 0.96).

580,31811715,Long-term ticagrelor for secondary prevention in patients with prior myocardial infarction and no history of coronary stenting: insights from PEGASUS-TIMI 54.,"AIMS


PEGASUS-TIMI 54 demonstrated that long-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and ticagrelor reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), with an acceptable increase in bleeding, in patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI). While much of the discussion around prolonged DAPT has been focused on stented patients, patients with prior MI without prior coronary stenting comprise a clinically important subgroup.
METHODS AND RESULTS


This was a pre-specified analysis from PEGASUS-TIMI 54, which randomized 21 162 patients with prior MI (1-3 years) and additional high-risk features to ticagrelor 60 mg, 90 mg, or placebo twice daily in addition to aspirin. A total of 4199 patients had no history of coronary stenting at baseline. The primary efficacy outcome (MACE) was the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke. Patients without history of coronary stenting had higher baseline risk of MACE [13.2% vs. 8.0%, adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-1.73, in the placebo arm]. The relative risk reduction in MACE with ticagrelor (pooled doses) was similar in patients without (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68-0.99) and with prior stenting (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75-0.96; P for interaction = 0.76).
CONCLUSION


Long-term ticagrelor reduces thrombotic events in patients with prior MI regardless of whether they had prior coronary stenting. These data highlight the benefits of DAPT in prevention of spontaneous atherothrombotic events and indicate that long-term ticagrelor may be considered in high-risk patients with prior MI even if they have not been treated with stenting.

581,32357269,A New Stimulation Mode for Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease: Theta Burst Stimulation.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES


The purpose of this study was to assess efficacy and safety of a new patterned theta burst stimulation algorithm of DBS with the aim of expanding the therapeutic window and clinical benefit in PD.
METHODS


In this single-center, randomized, double-blind, clinical short-term trial, unilateral conventional subthalamic DBS was compared with unilateral patterned stimulation algorithms with intraburst high- or low-frequency theta burst stimulation in 17 PD patients.
RESULTS


There were no serious adverse events with theta burst stimulation. During monopolar review, conventional subthalamic DBS and high-frequency theta burst stimulation were comparable, but low-frequency theta burst stimulation differed by requiring higher stimulation amplitudes for symptom reduction, but a larger therapeutic window. High- and low-frequency theta burst stimulation with adapted stimulation amplitude were effective in PD symptom reduction with differential effects on akinesia and tremor, depending on the theta burst stimulation mode.
CONCLUSIONS


Theta burst stimulation is a safe and effective stimulation mode with potential future application opportunities. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",2020,"High- and low-frequency theta burst stimulation with adapted stimulation amplitude were effective in PD symptom reduction with differential effects on akinesia and tremor, depending on the theta burst stimulation mode.

582,32357314,Does the Method of Administration Affect Reliability of the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure?,"BACKGROUND


Region-specific patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are commonly used in rehabilitation medicine. Digital versions of PROs may be implemented into electronic medical records and are also commonly used in research, but the validity of this method of administration (MOA) must be established.
PURPOSE


To determine the agreement between and compare the test-retest reliability of a paper version (FAAM-P) and digital version (FAAM-D) of the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM).
STUDY DESIGN


Randomized, nonblinded, crossover observational study.
METHODS


A total of 90 adults were randomized to complete the FAAM-P or FAAM-D first, and then completed the second MOA (first day [D1]). The FAAM-D was a digital adaptation of both FAAM-P subscales on Qualtrics. Identical test procedures were completed 1 week later (D2). Data were removed if a participant scored 100% on both MOA, reported injury between D1 and D2, or did not complete both MOA. Agreement was assessed on 46 participants between the 2 MOA using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) at D1. There was good-to-excellent test-retest reliability for the FAAM activities of daily living.
RESULTS


The authors observed good agreement between the FAAM-P and FAAM-D for the activities of daily living (ICC = .88) and sport scales (ICC = .87). Test-retest reliability was good-to-excellent for the FAAM activities of daily living (FAAM-P: ICC = .87; FAAM-D: ICC = .89) and sport (FAAM-P: ICC = .71; FAAM-D: ICC = .91).
CONCLUSIONS

583,32357329,The safety and efficacy of anterior versus posterior decompression surgery in degenerative cervical myelopathy: a prospective randomized trial.,"OBJECTIVE


The safety and efficacy of anterior and posterior decompression surgery in degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) have not been validated in any prospective randomized trial.
METHODS


In this first prospective randomized trial, the patients who had symptoms or signs of DCM were randomly assigned to undergo either anterior cervical discectomy and fusion or posterior laminectomy with or without fusion. The primary outcome measures were the change in the visual analog scale (VAS) score, Neck Disability Index (NDI), and Nurick myelopathy grade 1 year after surgery. The secondary outcome measures were intraoperative and postoperative complications, hospital stay, and Odom's criteria. The follow-up period was at least 1 year.
RESULTS


A total of 68 patients (mean age 53 ± 8.3 years, 72.3% men) underwent prospective randomization. There was a significantly better outcome in the NDI and VAS scores in the anterior group at 1 year (p < 0.05). Nurick myelopathy grading showed nonsignificant improvement using the posterior approach group (p = 0.79). The mean operative duration was significantly longer in the anterior group (p < 0.001). No significant difference in postoperative complications was found, except postoperative dysphagia was significantly higher in the anterior group (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in postoperative patient satisfaction (Odom's criteria) (p = 0.52). The mean hospital stay was significantly longer in the posterior group (p < 0.001).

584,32357362,Randomised controlled trial: Can topical timolol maleate prevent complications for small superficial infantile haemangiomata in high-risk areas?,"BACKGROUND


To define the role of topical timolol maleate (TTM) in the treatment of infantile haemangiomata (IH).
METHODS


In this single-centre randomised controlled trial, we included all <1-year-old infants within a 13-month period presenting with small (<2 cm) superficial IH located at high-risk areas (i.e. tip of ears, tip of nose, eyelids, acral areas, facial areas, scalp, neck, buttocks, perineum and axilla). Patients either received 12 months of 0.5% TTM solution (study group) or watchful waiting (control group). The primary outcome was IH with development of complications that required additional interventions. The secondary outcomes included side effects of TTM and change in IH size.
RESULTS


Forty-two children were eligible to the study. Patients who received TTM were noted to have significantly fewer complications than the control group (4.2% versus 29%, odds ratio 9.58 [95% confidence interval: 1.01-91.62], p = 0.04). Mean IH volume percentage reduction was significantly more for the TTM group and no-TTM group at 3, 6 and 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS


TTM is an effective and safe treatment option to reduce complications, IH volume and the need for further intervention for infants with small superficial IH located at high-risk areas.

585,32357364,PROMPT intervention for children with severe speech motor delay: a randomized control trial.,"BACKGROUND


Currently, there is limited information on the intervention efficacy for children with speech motor delay (SMD). This randomized control trial (RCT) study examined the effectiveness of Prompts for Restructuring Oral Muscular Phonetic Targets (PROMPT) intervention to improve the outcomes in children with SMD. We hypothesized that children with SMD receiving PROMPT intervention would improve more in the measured outcomes than those waitlisted and receiving home training.
METHODS


Using a two-arm, parallel group, RCT, 49 children with SMD were allocated to either an intervention group (N = 24) that received 45 min of PROMPT intervention two times a week for 10 weeks or were waitlisted for the same duration and received only home training instructions (N = 25). Outcome measures for speech motor control, articulation, speech intelligibility (word and sentence levels), and functional communication were assessed at baseline and at a 10-week follow-up.
RESULTS


PROMPT intervention was associated with notable improvements in speech motor control, speech articulation, and word-level speech intelligibility. Intervention allocation yielded weak improvements in sentence-level speech intelligibility and functional communication.
CONCLUSIONS


PROMPT intervention is a clinically effective intervention approach for children with SMD.
IMPACT

This is considered a mixed formative approach that combines face-to-face and outside the classroom education. The objective of this research was to analyze the effectiveness of flipped learning methodology on a traditional training practice in dietary training, both in the sixth grade of primary education and in the fourth level of secondary education. A quasi-experimental design was adopted with two experimental groups, two control groups and only posttest. The final sample was composed of 115 students divided into four groups, two of each educational stage mentioned. A didactic unit consisting of six sessions in all groups was applied. Two different training methodologies were followed according to the nature of the group (control-traditional; experimental-flipped learning). The results reveal that flipped learning is effective both in primary education and in secondary education, being more influential in student development in this last stage.

587,32354280,Reduced Diuretic Dose in Patients Treated With Eplerenone: Data From the EPHESUS Trial.,"BACKGROUND


Loop diuretics are used for congestion relief, and dose adaptations are usually a consequence of the clinicians' clinical judgement about the congestive status of the patient. In EPHESUS (Eplerenone in Patients With Systolic Dysfunction After Myocardial Infarction), many patients required diuretics for congestion relief. We thus hypothesized that blinded allocation to eplerenone would lead clinicians to reduce loop diuretics, as a consequence of the improvement in patients' status.
METHODS


Cox and mixed-effects models were used over a median follow-up of 1.3 years in 6632 patients.
RESULTS


A total of 6632 patients were included; at baseline, 3352 (50.5%) did not have diuretics, 2195 (33.1%) had diuretic doses between 1 and 40 mg/day, and 1085 (16.4%) had diuretic doses >40 mg/day. Patients with higher furosemide equivalent doses had a worse clinical status. Both baseline and follow-up incremental loop diuretic doses were associated with worse prognosis. Eplerenone treatment was associated with lower prescribed loop diuretic doses throughout the follow-up; lower doses were observed at 90 days and decreased further at 180 days and beyond. Eplerenone treatment led to a mean furosemide equivalent dose reduction of -2.2 mg/day (-2.9 to -1.6) throughout the follow-up. Eplerenone was effective in reducing morbidity and mortality regardless of the baseline loop diuretic dose used: hazard ratio for the outcome of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization was 0.83 ([95% CI, 0.75-0.92];  P  for interaction, 0.54).
CONCLUSIONS


Eplerenone treatment led to a loop diuretic dose reduction during follow-up without evidence of treatment effect modification by loop diuretics. These findings suggest that eplerenone reduces congestive signs and symptoms, which enables clinicians to reduce loop diuretic doses.",2020,Eplerenone treatment was associated with lower prescribed loop diuretic doses throughout the follow-up; lower doses were observed at 90 days and decreased further at 180 days and beyond.,"['A total of 6632 patients were included; at baseline, 3352 (50.5%) did not have diuretics, 2195 (33.1%) had diuretic doses between 1 and 40 mg/day, and 1085 (16.4%) had diuretic doses', 'Patients With Systolic Dysfunction', '6632 patients']","['eplerenone', 'Eplerenone']","['morbidity and mortality', 'congestion relief', 'cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization']","[{'cui': 'C0439810', 'cui_str': 'Total'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0332257', 'cui_str': 'Including'}, {'cui': 'C0168634', 'cui_str': 'BaseLine dental cement'}, {'cui': 'C1299585', 'cui_str': 'Does not'}, {'cui': 'C0012798', 'cui_str': 'Diuretic'}, {'cui': 'C0439422', 'cui_str': 'mg/24h'}, {'cui': 'C0749225', 'cui_str': 'Systolic dysfunction'}]","[{'cui': 'C0961485', 'cui_str': 'eplerenone'}]","[{'cui': 'C0026538', 'cui_str': 'Morbidity'}, {'cui': 'C0026565', 'cui_str': 'Mortality rate'}, {'cui': 'C0700148', 'cui_str': 'Congestion'}, {'cui': 'C0564405', 'cui_str': 'Feeling relief'}, {'cui': 'C0007226', 'cui_str': 'Structure of cardiovascular system'}, {'cui': 'C0011065', 'cui_str': 'Death'}, {'cui': 'C0018801', 'cui_str': 'Heart failure'}, {'cui': 'C0019993', 'cui_str': 'Inpatient care'}]",6632.0,0.157846,Eplerenone treatment was associated with lower prescribed loop diuretic doses throughout the follow-up; lower doses were observed at 90 days and decreased further at 180 days and beyond.,"[{'ForeName': 'João Pedro', 'Initials': 'JP', 'LastName': 'Ferreira', 'Affiliation': 'Universite de Lorraine, Clinical Investigation Center 1433, French Clinical Research Infrastructure Network Investigation Network Initiative-Cardiovascular and Renal Clinical Trialists, Centre Hospitalier Regional et Universitaire de Nancy, INSERM Unite 1116 (J.P.F., K.

Methods:  Totally 120 patients were randomly divided using computer-generated numbers into a control group (n = 60; ICP, 60 cmH 2 O) and a PIP group (n = 60), in which ICP was increased with 5 cmH 2 O each time from PIP level until no air leaks from the oropharynx. PIP, ICP, cuff volume (CV), oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP) and leak fraction (LF) were recorded before and after pneumoperitoneum establishment. Postoperative pharyngolaryngeal complications (sore throat, dysphagia, pharyngeal hematoma, and dysphonia) were also recorded. Results:  Demographic data were similar in the two groups. The CV and ICP before and after pneumoperitoneum were significantly lower in the PIP group (CV: 15.6 ± 2.3 mL and 21.0 ± 2.6 mL; ICP: 14.3 ± 2.9 cmH 2 O and 20.5 ± 3.4 cmH 2 O) than in the control group (CV: 33.0 ± 2.8 mL and 32.8 ± 1.9 mL; ICP: 60.0 ± 0.1 cmH 2 O and 60.0 ± 0.1 cmH 2 O) ( P  < 0.05). Although OLP was lower in the PIP group ( P  < 0.05), the LF was similar in the two groups ( P  > 0.05). There were fewer postoperative pharyngolaryngeal complications in the PIP group ( P  < 0.05).

Corticosteroid injection to the subacromial bursa is one of the confirmed therapies which can be guided by anatomic landmarks or ultrasound. This study is aimed to compare these two methods to find the one with the highest therapeutic impact. Materials and methods : In this study, 30 patients with paraplegic SCI suffering from shoulder pain were enrolled. They were divided into 2 groups based on 4-block randomization sampling. The first group received subacromial corticosteroid injection through anatomic landmarks; while in the second group, the injection was guided by ultrasound. VAS criterion was employed for investigation of pain severity; while the constant score was used to study the shoulder pain and function. BREF questionnaire was also applied to examine the quality of life. Findings : The mean scores of VAS and Constant in both groups showed a significant improvement two months after intervention when compared with their condition before the intervention. This improvement was significantly higher in the ultrasound group. The physical, physiological and environmental health scores of BREF questionnaire as well as their total score showed a significant improvement in both groups two months after intervention.

590,32354362,Septoplasty versus non-surgical management for nasal obstruction in adults with a deviated septum: economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND


For years, the benefits of septoplasty have been questioned. Due to the scarce and inconclusive literature, several National Health Service (NHS) Clinical Commissioning Groups in England decided to add septal surgery to their list of restricted procedures with low clinical value. Recently, evidence was obtained that septoplasty is actually more effective than non-surgical management for nasal obstruction in adults with a deviated septum. However, the relation between costs and effects of septoplasty remains unknown.
METHODS


We conducted an economic evaluation alongside an open, multicenter, pragmatic randomized controlled trial in two tertiary and 16 secondary referral hospitals in the Netherlands. Adults with nasal obstruction and a deviated septum were randomized to (1) septoplasty with or without concurrent turbinate surgery or (2) non-surgical management consisting of (a combination of) medical treatment and watchful waiting. Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Single imputation nested in the bootstrap percentile method (using 5000 bootstrap replications) was performed to assess the effect of missing data. After 12 and 24 months, we assessed the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from a healthcare and a societal perspective.
RESULTS


A total of 203 adults were randomly assigned to septoplasty (N = 102) or non-surgical management (N = 101). After 12 months, the mean cost difference between septoplasty and non-surgical management using a healthcare or societal perspective was €1181 (95%CI €1038 to €1323) or €2192 per patient (95%CI €1714 to €2670), respectively. The mean QALY difference was 0.03 per patient (95%CI - 0.01 to 0.07). Incremental costs per QALY gained from a healthcare or societal perspective were €41,763 or €77,525, respectively. After 24 months, the mean cost difference between the two groups using a healthcare or societal perspective decreased to €936 (95%CI €719 to €1153) or €1671 per patient (95%CI €952 to €2390), respectively. The mean QALY difference increased to 0.05 per patient (95%CI - 0.03 to 0.14). Incremental costs per QALY gained from a healthcare or societal perspective became €17,374 or €31,024, respectively. Analyses of imputed data did not alter our findings.
CONCLUSIONS


Depending on the selected perspective, cost-effectiveness threshold, and time horizon, septoplasty has the potential to be cost-effective. Despite considerable uncertainty, septoplasty seems to be cost-effective from a healthcare perspective, after 24 months against a threshold of €20,000 per QALY. From a societal perspective, septoplasty is not yet cost-effective after 24 months, but it comes closer to the cost-effectiveness threshold as time passes by.

The objective of this prospective randomized clinical trial was to investigate the relationship between clear aligner (CA) therapy and the development of white spot lesions and compare it with orthodontic fixed appliance (FA) therapy.
METHODS


This was a prospective randomized clinical trial. The setting was the postgraduate orthodontic clinic at Jordan University of Science and Technology. A total of 49 patients (39 female, 10 male; mean age ± standard deviation, 21.25 ± 3 years) who required orthodontic treatment with either FAs or CAs were randomly allocated into 1 of 2 study groups. Eligibility criteria included healthy patients of both sexes (age range 17-24 years), Class I malocclusion with mild-to-moderate crowding (≤5 mm), nonextraction treatment plan, and optimum oral hygiene before treatment as determined by clinical examination. The participants were randomly assigned to a study group according to a simple randomization method using a coin toss by the patient; the text or tail side of the coin indicated treatment with CA (group 1), and the head side of the coin indicated orthodontic treatment with FA (group 2). Blinding was applicable for outcome assessment only. CA therapy was performed for group 1 and FA for group 2. Quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) images were taken before treatment (T 0 ) and 3 months later (T 1 ). The QLF images were then analyzed to assess the research outcomes. The main outcome was the mean amount of fluorescence loss (ΔF). Number of newly developed lesions, deepest point in the lesion (ΔF Max ), lesion area (pixels), and plaque surface area (ΔR 30 ) were measured as secondary outcomes. Descriptive statistics and comparison within and between groups were calculated.
RESULTS


In total, 42 of the 49 participants recruited completed the study (19 in the CA group and 23 in the FA group). The mean amount of fluorescence loss was 0.4% for the CA group (P = 0.283) and 1.2% for the FA group (P = 0.013). The difference between the 2 groups was significant (confidence interval [CI], -1.8 to -0.4; P = 0.002). The mean increase in lesion area was 82.2 pixels for the CA group (P <0.001) and 9.3 pixels for the FA group (P = 0.225). The difference between the 2 groups was significant (CI, -117 to -75.0; P <0.001). ΔR 30  was 1.2% for the CA group and 10.9% for the FA group (CI, 6.847-12.479; P <0.001). The number of newly developed lesions in the CA group was 6 lesions/patient and 8.25 in the FA group (P = 0.039). No serious harm on the oral health of the participants in the 2 study groups was observed other than mild gingivitis associated with plaque accumulation. No serious harm was reported by any of the participants.
CONCLUSIONS


Orthodontic treatment with CAs and FAs caused enamel demineralization. The CA group developed larger but shallower white spot lesions, whereas the FA group developed more new lesions with greater severity, but they were smaller in area. More plaque accumulation was found in the FA group compared with the CA group.

The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of distraction cards and a kaleidoscope in reducing pain during phlebotomy procedures among children aged 6 to 12.
DESIGN


This randomized controlled study involved intervention groups and a control group.
METHODS


Data were obtained by the use of an information form and the visual analog scale. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics as well as Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon, and post hoc tests.
FINDINGS


During the phlebotomy, children in the control group experienced more pain than children in the distraction cards group and kaleidoscope group (P < .001). There was no significant difference between pain scores of the two intervention groups (P > .05). Both methods were found to be effective in reducing pain.

593,32354590,Reducing Pain During Emergency Arterial Sampling Using Three Anesthetic Methods: A Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial.,"BACKGROUND


Taking a sample of arterial blood is widely reported as a cause of significant pain.
OBJECTIVES


To compare three anesthetic methods with standard practice (no anesthesia) to establish which was the most effective in reducing pain caused by radial artery puncture in patients requiring an arterial blood gas test in the emergency department (ED).
METHODS


A randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the effectiveness between anesthetic cream, cryoanalgesia, and subcutaneous mepivacaine in reducing pain caused by radial artery puncture in ED patients.
RESULTS


After comparing perceived pain during arterial puncture, the lowest median score was obtained in the mepivacaine group (1 interquartile range 0.6-1.3) and the highest median score in the control group (5 interquartile range 4.0-7.0). When comparing the control group with the three intervention groups, the Kruskal-Wallis test showed that mepivacaine (p = 0.023) and cryoanalgesia (p = 0.012) were associated with significantly lower pain scores. The anesthetic cream (p = 0.861) intervention group did not produce a statistically significant median difference compared with the control group.
CONCLUSIONS


The results of this study encourage the use of anesthetic methods like cryoanalgesia or mepivacaine for their proven effectiveness in reducing or eliminating pain during arterial puncture.",2020,"The anesthetic cream (p = 0.861) intervention group did not produce a statistically significant median difference compared with the control group.

595,32354652,Prospective randomized study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Ectoin® containing Eye Spray (EES09) and comparison to the liposomal Eye Spray Tears Again® (TA) in the treatment of dry eye disease.,"PURPOSE


To subjectively and objectively evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of preservative-free Ectoin ® Eye Spray - Colloidal (EES09) and Tears Again ® Eye Spray (TA) in subjects with mild-moderate dry eye disease (DED), and to compare efficacy of these two eye sprays with each other.
METHODS


Thirty-six volunteers (average age 32.3 ± 16.1 years; 26 females) were successfully recruited for this prospective double-blind study with between-subject design and randomly divided into two groups (gender and age balanced): Group A received EES09 and Group B received TA during the treatment phase. Inclusioncriteria were a minimum age of 18 years, a score of 18.0 or higher on the OSDI questionnaire, and a non-invasive tear break up time (NIKBUT, Oculus Keratograph M5, Oculus, Germany) of no more than 10s in at least one eye. The objective variables NIKBUT, conjunctival redness, lipid layer and osmolarity (TearLab Cooperation, USA) were assessed at baseline, 10 min. after spray application and after a treatment phase of 10±3 days (3x applications daily). Symptoms, tolerance and handling were evaluated with the OSDI and VAS questionnaires.
RESULTS


A statistically significant increase in NIKBUT and improvement in DED symptoms were obtained for the overall group (mean NIKBUT 7.7 ± 1.7s vs. 11.6 ± 4.6s, p<0.001; mean OSDI score: 36.1 ± 12.7 vs. 20. 7± 12.7, p<0.001) during course of treatment. No statistically significant effect was established for the variables lipid layer (p = 0.406), conjunctival redness (p = 0.766) and osmolarity (p = 0.378). No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups, for any variable. The noninferioritycriterion for EES09 towards TA could be shown for the scores of the dry eye symptoms via VAS questionnaire and the variable NIKBUT.

596,32354661,How continuum beliefs can reduce stigma of schizophrenia: The role of perceived similarities.,"Growing evidence has shown continuum beliefs as a promising tool to reduce psychiatric stigma in the general population, but data still lack regarding mechanisms underlying this effect. This study aims at testing the hypothesis that continuum beliefs affect public stigma and self-stigma by increasing perceived similarities between oneself and people with schizophrenia. Perceiving such similarities may reduce public stigma and increase self-stigma in the general population. The current study was preregistered on OSF. Data were collected via an on-line survey (N = 565). Participants were randomly assigned to one of the three experimental conditions. Continuum beliefs were induced with short videos supporting either a continuum viewpoint of schizophrenia, a categorial viewpoint of schizophrenia, or a neutral video. A scale of Perceived similarities between oneself and people with schizophrenia was administered. Public stigma was measured with an Essentialism scale and Self-stigma with a scale of self-stereotype association. Mediation analyses showed that the effects of categorial and continuum beliefs on essentialism and self-stereotype association were mediated by perceived similarities.

We examined the efficacy of a culturally relevant, community-based HPV vaccination intervention among Latinx immigrant mothers with daughters aged 9-12 in Alabama.
METHODS


We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial with ""place of residence"" (e.g., apartment complexes, trailer parks) as the unit of randomization that evaluated two interventions: 1) promotion of HPV vaccination and 2) promotion of healthy eating and appropriate nutrition label interpretation. Identical baseline/post/7-month follow up questionnaires were completed by all participants and both interventions consisted of four group sessions and one individual session. A total of 40 locations were randomized with 317 mother-daughter dyads enrolled in the study between May 2013 and October 2017.
RESULTS


A total of 278 mother-daughter dyads met full eligibility and initiated the intervention/control participation. Retention rate overall was 93.2% (92.6% for the intervention arm and 93.7% for the control arm). Daughters in the intervention arm were significantly more likely to receive one, two, and three doses of HPV vaccine than daughters in the control arm p < 0.001). In multivariate analyses, mothers in the intervention arm had a six times greater odds of vaccinating daughters with the first dose (OR = 5.96, 95% CI: 3.38, 10.49), eight times greater odds of vaccinating daughters with the second dose (OR = 8.09, 95% CI: 4.0, 16.35), and more than 16 times greater odds of completing the three-dose HPV vaccine series than mothers in the control arm after adjusting for mother's age, time in the U.S., income, and daughter's health insurance status (OR = 16.5, 95% CI: 5.73, 47.48). Only perceived risk of their daughters' future HPV infection remained significant as a predictor of three-dose HPV vaccination completion (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.23, 2.1).

598,32354777,"Results of a prospective, mixed methods study to assess feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of TRIumPH (Treatment and Recovery In PsycHosis): an integrated care pathway for psychosis, compared to usual treatment.","OBJECTIVES


To evaluate whether a newly developed care pathway, Treatment and Recovery In PsycHosis (TRIumPH), is feasible, acceptable and effective in meeting National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) quality standards in a timely manner.
METHODS


This is a pragmatic, non-randomised, prospective, mixed methods study comparing an implementation (TRIumPH) and comparator site (not implementing TRIumPH) across three cohorts to assess feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of the integrated pathway.
SETTING


Early intervention in psychosis (EIP) services at two National Health Service organisations in South of England.
PARTICIPANTS


All patients accepted into EIP services between 1 June 2014 and 31 May 2017 were each followed up for 1 year within their respective cohorts.
METHODOLOGY


Quantitative data consisted of routinely collected clinical data retrieved from patient records to assess whether the implementation of TRIumPH achieved better concordance to NICE standards. These included time to access services, physical health assessments, clinical outcomes based timeliness of delivery and acute data. The controlled trial has evaluated the effect of TRIumPH (Intervention) with Care As Usual (Comparator). Qualitative measures consisted of questionnaires, interviews and focus groups to assess acceptability and satisfaction. Outcome measures were compared within the baseline, year 1 and year 2 cohorts and between the two sites. Quantitative data were statistically analysed by comparing means and proportions.
RESULTS


Time to assessment improved in the implementation site and remained within the target in comparator site. Meeting of quality standards increased substantially in the implementation site but was more variable and reached lower levels in the comparator site especially for physical health standards. Cognitive therapy for psychosis, family intervention and carer and employment support were all offered to a greater extent in the implementation site and uptake increased over the period.
CONCLUSIONS


Pathway implementation generally led to greater improvements in achievement of access and quality standards compared with comparator site.

Canagliflozin reduced renal and cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes in the CREDENCE trial. We assessed efficacy and safety of canagliflozin by initial estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
METHODS


CREDENCE randomly assigned 4401 participants with an eGFR of 30 to <90 ml/min per 1.73 m 2  and substantial albuminuria to canagliflozin 100 mg or placebo. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to analyze effects on renal and cardiovascular efficacy and safety outcomes within screening eGFR subgroups (30 to <45, 45 to <60, and 60 to <90 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 ) and linear mixed effects models to analyze the effects on eGFR slope.
RESULTS


At screening, 1313 (30%), 1279 (29%), and 1809 (41%) participants had an eGFR of 30 to <45, 45 to <60, and 60 to <90 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 , respectively. The relative benefits of canagliflozin for renal and cardiovascular outcomes appeared consistent among eGFR subgroups (all  P  interaction >0.11). Subgroups with lower eGFRs, who were at greater risk, exhibited larger absolute benefits for renal outcomes. Canagliflozin's lack of effect on serious adverse events, amputations, and fractures appeared consistent among eGFR subgroups. In all subgroups, canagliflozin use led to an acute eGFR drop followed by relative stabilization of eGFR loss. Among those with an eGFR of 30 to <45 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 , canagliflozin led to an initial drop of 2.03 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 . Thereafter, decline in eGFR was slower in the canagliflozin versus placebo group (-1.72 versus -4.33 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 ; between-group difference 2.61 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 ).
CONCLUSIONS


Canagliflozin safely reduced the risk of renal and cardiovascular events, with consistent results across eGFR subgroups, including the subgroup initiating treatment with an eGFR of 30 to <45 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 . Absolute benefits for renal outcomes were greatest in subgroups with lower eGFR.

600,32355067,Impact of diabetes on clinical outcome among elderly patients with acute coronary syndrome treated with percutaneous coronary intervention: insights from the ELDERLY ACS 2 trial.,"BACKGROUND


Despite recent improvements in percutaneous coronary revascularization and antithrombotic therapies for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes, the outcome is still unsatisfactory in high-risk patients, such as the elderly and patients with diabetes. The aim of the current study was to investigate the prognostic impact of diabetes on clinical outcome among patients included in the Elderly-ACS 2 trial, a randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint study carried out at 32 centers in Italy.
METHODS


Our population is represented by 1443 patients included in the Elderly-ACS 2 trial. Diabetes was defined as known history of diabetes at admission. The primary endpoint of this analysis was cardiovascular mortality, while secondary endpoints were all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction, Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 2 or 3 bleeding, and rehospitalization for cardiovascular event or stent thrombosis within 12 months after index admission.
RESULTS


Diabetes was present in 419 (29%) out of 1443 patients. Diabetic status was significantly associated with major cardiovascular risk factors and history of previous coronary disease, presentation with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (P = 0.01) more extensive coronary disease (P = 0.02), more advanced Killip class at presentation (P = 0.003), use at admission of statins (P = 0.004) and diuretics at discharge (P < 0.001). Median follow-up was 367 days (interquartile range: 337-378 days). Diabetic status was associated with an absolute increase in the rate of cardiovascular mortality as compared with patients without diabetes [5.5 vs. 3.3%, hazard ratio (HR) 1.7 (0.99-2.8), P = 0.054], particularly among those treated with clopidogrel [HR (95% confidence interval (CI)) = 1.89 (0.93-3.87), P = 0.08]. However, this difference disappeared after correction for baseline differences [Adjusted HR (95% CI) 1.1(0.4-2.9), P = 0.86]. Similar findings were observed for other secondary endpoints, except for bleeding complications, significantly more frequent in diabetic patients [HR (95% CI) 2.02 (1.14-3.6), P = 0.02; adjusted HR (95% CI) = 2.1 (1.01-4.3), P = 0.05]. No significant interaction was observed between type of dual antiplatelet therapy, diabetic status and outcome.
CONCLUSION


Among elderly patients with acute coronary syndromes, diabetic status was associated with higher rates of comorbidities, more severe cardiovascular risk profile and major bleeding complications fully accounting for the absolute increase in mortality. In fact, diabetes mellitus did not emerge as an independent predictor of survival in advanced age.",2020,"Diabetic status was associated with an absolute increase in the rate of cardiovascular

601,32355123,Besifovir Dipivoxil Maleate 144-Week Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B: An Open-Label Extensional Study of a Phase 3 Trial.,"OBJECTIVES


Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) remains a major worldwide public health concern. Besifovir dipivoxil maleate (BSV) is a new promising treatment for CHB. However, long-term efficacy and safety have not yet been evaluated. Therefore, the goal of the study is to determine the antiviral efficacy and safety of BSV treatment over a 144-week duration (BSV-BSV) in comparison with those of a sequential treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) followed by a 96-week duration BSV administration (TDF-BSV).
METHODS


After 48 weeks of a double-blind comparison between BSV and TDF treatments, patients continued the open-label BSV study. We evaluated antiviral efficacy and drug safety up to 144 weeks for BSV-BSV and TDF-BSV groups. The primary endpoint was a virological response (hepatitis B virus DNA < 69 IU/mL).
RESULTS


Among the 197 patients enrolled, 170 and 158 patients entered the second-year and third-year open-label phase extensional study, respectively, whereas 153 patients completed the 144-week follow-up. The virological response rate over the 144-week period was 87.7% and 92.1% in BSV-BSV and TDF-BSV groups, respectively (P = 0.36). The rates of ALT normalization and HBeAg seroconversion were similar between the groups. No drug-resistant mutations to BSV were noted. Bone mineral density and renal function were well preserved in the BSV-BSV group and were significantly improved after switching therapy in TDF-BSV patients.
DISCUSSION


This extensional study of a phase 3 trial (NCT01937806) suggests that BSV treatment is efficacious and safe for long-term use in treatment-naïve and TDF-experienced patients with CHB.",2020,"Bone mineral density and renal function were well preserved in the BSV-BSV group and were significantly improved after switching therapy in TDF-BSV patients.

602,32355450,A quasi-experiment on using guided mobile learning interventions in ESL classrooms: Time use and academic performance.,"This quasi-experimental study examined a guided learning approach towards the use of mobile devices and investigated the performance of language learners who were guided in the usage. A total of 419 students from two faculties were invited to participate in this 8-week intervention, 155 participants in the control group and 264 in the experimental group. In the experimental group, the researchers incorporated guided activities Module Intervention Model (MIM) using mobile devices into the ESL lessons whereas the control group lessons were without guided activities. Participants from both groups were asked to record their daily mobile device use for activities related to English language learning using an online form. These data were compared to the results of the tests conducted pre- and post-treatment. At the end of the study, students who received guided language activities utilizing the mobile devices had significantly higher levels of language performance than control group students.

604,32357899,Efficacy and safety of Shengjiang Xiexin decoction in prophylaxis of chemotherapy-related diarrhea in small cell lung cancer patients: study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND


Diarrhea is a common adverse reaction in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy, for which there is currently no effective method of treatment. Shengjiang Xiexin decoction (SXD), a classic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, has shown efficacy in alleviating irinotecan-induced diarrhea in preliminary clinical studies. The current study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of SXD for prophylaxis against irinotecan-induced diarrhea. Additionally, we employ a new approach to analyze and evaluate the data based on the patients' uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) genotype, which predicts the risk of diarrhea.
METHODS AND DESIGN


A prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial will be conducted in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) from five hospitals in China. For this study, 100 irinotecan-naïve patients will be randomly allocated to either the SXD or placebo arms in a 1:1 ratio. Stratified randomization will be used to divide subjects by UGT1A1 genotype into groups with differing risk of diarrhea. The trial will consist of two cycles of chemotherapy with 14 days of oral administration of SXD or placebo administered beginning between 3 days before and up to 11 days after initiation of each chemotherapy cycle. The primary study outcome is the incidence of diarrhea. Secondary outcomes include the degree of diarrhea, the degree of neutropenia, the rate of alterations in chemotherapy regimens, the amount of antidiarrheal drug taken, the rate of hospitalization, and evaluation of chemotherapy efficacy.
DISCUSSION


This study is the first to use the UGT1A1 genotype to stratify patients into groups based on their risk of diarrhea, and to provide a complete assessment of chemotherapy-related diarrhea (CRD), including records of diarrhea duration, grading the severity of diarrhea, and evaluating concomitant symptoms. Study results will provide high-level clinical evidence on the use of SXD as prophylaxis for CRD.

605,32357900,A randomized controlled trial on the effects of oxymetazoline nasal spray after dacryocystorhinostomy among adult patients.,"OBJECTIVES


The study aimed to determine the effect of oxymetazoline nasal spray on the patency of the fistula created after dacryocystorhinostomy, specifically: to compare the success of fistula formation with oxymetazoline versus placebo, and to compare the incidence of post-operative congestion, pain and bleeding with oxymetazoline versus placebo.
RESULTS


The study was a single-center, randomized controlled, triple-masked study involving the patients of the Plastic-Lacrimal service of a national university hospital. Block randomization was done. Dacryocystorhinostomy was performed by a single-masked surgeon. The intervention group used oxymetazoline. The placebo group used sodium chloride. The data were collected by another masked investigator. The study showed no significant difference in terms of congestion, pain and epistaxis between the two groups at day 2 post-operation. The patency, presence of silicone tube, granuloma formation, and presence of bleeding on both day 2 and day 16 post-operation had no difference between the two groups. This study doesn't support the use of oxymetazoline nasal spray after DCR, since it does not decrease the symptoms of congestion, pain and epistaxis after DCR. Aside from being an additional expense for patients, it also does not affect fistula formation and success rate of the surgery.

606,32357903,"Peer support for people with severe mental illness versus usual care in high-, middle- and low-income countries: study protocol for a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial (UPSIDES-RCT).","BACKGROUND


Peer support is an established intervention involving a person recovering from mental illness supporting others with mental illness. Peer support is an under-used resource in global mental health. Building upon comprehensive formative research, this study will rigorously evaluate the impact of peer support at multiple levels, including service user outcomes (psychosocial and clinical), peer support worker outcomes (work role and empowerment), service outcomes (cost-effectiveness and return on investment), and implementation outcomes (adoption, sustainability and organisational change).
METHODS


UPSIDES-RCT is a pragmatic, parallel-group, multicentre, randomised controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of using peer support in developing empowering mental health services (UPSIDES) at four measurement points over 1 year (baseline, 4-, 8- and 12-month follow-up), with embedded process evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis. Research will take place in a range of high-, middle- and low-income countries (Germany, UK, Israel, India, Uganda and Tanzania). The primary outcome is social inclusion of service users with severe mental illness (N = 558; N = 93 per site) at 8-month follow-up, measured with the Social Inclusion Scale. Secondary outcomes include empowerment (using the Empowerment Scale), hope (using the HOPE scale), recovery (using Stages of Recovery) and health and social functioning (using the Health of the Nations Outcome Scales). Mixed-methods process evaluation will investigate mediators and moderators of effect and the implementation experiences of four UPSIDES stakeholder groups (service users, peer support workers, mental health workers and policy makers). A cost-effectiveness analysis examining cost-utility and health budget impact will estimate the value for money of UPSIDES peer support.
DISCUSSION


The UPSIDES-RCT will explore the essential components necessary to create a peer support model in mental health care, while providing the evidence required to sustain and eventually scale-up the intervention in different cultural, organisational and resource settings. By actively involving and empowering service users, UPSIDES will move mental health systems toward a recovery orientation, emphasising user-centredness, community participation and the realisation of mental health as a human right.

607,32357913,Effects of perioperative enhanced recovery after surgery pathway management versus traditional management on the clinical outcomes of laparoscopic-assisted radical resection of distal gastric cancer: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND


The incidence of gastric cancer in East Asia is much higher than the international average. Therefore, improving the prognosis of patients and establishing effective clinical pathways are important topics for the prevention and treatment of gastric cancer. At present, the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathway is widely used in the field of gastric surgery. Many randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies have proven that the ERAS regimen can improve the short-term clinical outcomes of patients with gastric cancer. However, a prospective study on the effect of the ERAS pathway on the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer has not yet been reported. This trial aims to confirm whether the ERAS pathway can improve the disease-free survival and overall survival of patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted radical resection for distal gastric cancer.
METHODS/DESIGN


This study is a prospective, multicentre RCT. This experiment will consist of two groups - an experimental group and a control group - randomly divided in a 1:1 ratio. The perioperative period of the experimental group will be managed according to the ERAS pathway and that of the control group will be managed according to the traditional management mode. An estimated 400 patients will be enrolled. The main endpoint for comparison is the 3-year overall survival and disease-free survival between the two groups.
DISCUSSION


The results of this RCT should clarify whether the ERAS pathway is superior to traditional treatment on inflammatory indexes, short-term clinical outcome and survival for laparoscopic-assisted radical resection of distal gastric cancer. It is hoped that our data will provide evidence that the ERAS pathway improves survival in patients with gastric cancer.

In total, 540 parents (321 females, 219 males) of adolescent athletes participated in a brief educational workshop on youth mental health (n = 352) or a community-matched control group (n = 188). Generalised linear mixed models revealed no significant improvements in the intervention group compared to control in the primary mental health literacy outcomes, at 1 month follow-up. However, parents in the intervention group were more likely to seek formal help for themselves, had increased confidence and knowledge to help someone experiencing a mental health disorder, experienced reduced psychological distress, and perceived more support from other parents in their sport club, relative to the control group.

609,32367201,No clinical difference between TiN-coated versus uncoated cementless CoCrMo mobile-bearing total knee arthroplasty; 10-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial.,"PURPOSE


Improvement of biomechanical properties of cobalt-chromium-molybdenum (CoCrMo) implant surface and reduction of adhesive wear is achieved by titanium-nitride (TiN) coating in vitro. Less pain, higher postoperative outcome scores and a lower revision rate after TKA with a TiN-coated CoCrMo TKA compared with uncoated CoCrMo TKA after 10-year follow-up was hypothesized.
METHODS


In a double-blinded RCT, 101 patients received a cementless mobile-bearing CoCrMo TKA, either TiN-coated or uncoated. The primary outcome measure was the visual analogue scale (VAS) score for pain and secondary outcome measures were the Knee Society Score (KSS), Oxford Knee Score (OKS), revision rate and adverse events. Patients were assessed at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years and 10 years, postoperatively.
RESULTS


68 patients (67%) were available for 10-year follow-up. No difference was found in any of the assessed outcome measures with a mean decrease in VAS score (31.6 ± 22.9) and a mean increase in OKS (10.9 ± 8.4), KSS (29.3 ± 31.4), KSSK (26.4 ± 18.2) and KSSF (4.1 ± 22.9). Overall revision rate was 7% (coated 6% vs uncoated 8%) without additional revision procedures between 5 and 10-year follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS


The in vitro potential benefits of TiN coating did not result in better clinical outcome when compared to an uncoated cementless TKA. Pain, functional outcome and revision rates were comparable after 10-year follow-up. TiN-coated cementless TKA provides comparable good long-term results, similar to uncoated cementless CoCrMo TKA.

610,32367234,Is selective nerve root block necessary for learning percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy: a comparative study using a cumulative summation test for learning curve.,"PURPOSE


The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of lumbar spine selective nerve root block (SNRB) experience on the learning efficiency of percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) for junior trainees.
METHODS


A total of 480 patients undergoing single-level PELD performed by eight junior trainees were included. The trainees were divided into two groups based on whether they had previous SNRB experience (group A, yes; group B, no). Surgical proficiency was defined as total operation time less than 65 minutes and cumulative radiation exposure time no more than 40 seconds. The learning curve was analyzed by cumulative summation (CUSUM) test. Clinical evaluations included Macnab classification, visual analog scale (VAS)-low back score, VAS-leg score, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Follow-up information at 12 months was also obtained.
RESULTS


Integral number of cases before achieving an acceptable surgical level in group A (47.75 ± 2.50 cases) was significantly smaller than that in group B (56.50 ± 1.29 cases, p < 0.05), along with less accumulated failure (18.75 ± 0.96 cases vs. 25.50 ± 1.75 cases, p < 0.05). The two groups were comparable in clinical outcomes. Forty-seven cases of complications were observed, with 17 in group A and 30 in group B (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION


Previous experience of SNRB improved the performance of PELD with shorter operation time and less radiation exposure. SNRB practice may reduce the complication rate without a significant effect on the recurrence of symptoms and reoperation.",2020,"Forty-seven cases of complications were observed, with 17 in group A and 30 in group B (p < 0.05).

611,32367254,The effects of a 2-year physical activity and dietary intervention on plasma lipid concentrations in children: the PANIC Study.,"PURPOSE


We studied the effects of a physical activity and dietary intervention on plasma lipids in a general population of children. We also investigated how lifestyle changes contributed to the intervention effects.
METHODS


We carried out a 2-year controlled, non-randomized lifestyle intervention study among 504 mainly prepubertal children aged 6-9 years at baseline. We assigned 306 children to the intervention group and 198 children to the control group. We assessed plasma concentrations of total, LDL, HDL, and VLDL cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL triglycerides, and VLDL triglycerides. We evaluated the consumption of foods using 4-day food records and physical activity using a movement and heart rate sensor. We analyzed data using linear mixed-effect models adjusted for age at baseline, sex, and pubertal stage at both time points. Furthermore, specific lifestyle variables were entered in these models.
RESULTS


Plasma LDL cholesterol decreased in the intervention group but did not change in the control group ( - 0.05 vs. 0.00 mmol/L, regression coefficient (β) =  - 0.0385, p = 0.040 for group*time interaction). This effect was mainly explained by the changes in the consumption of high-fat vegetable oil-based spreads (β =  - 0.0203, + 47% change in β) and butter-based spreads (β =  - 0.0294, + 30% change in β), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (β =  - 0.0268, + 30% change in β), light physical activity (β =  - 0.0274, + 29% change in β) and sedentary time (β =  - 0.0270, + 30% change in β). The intervention had no effect on other plasma lipids.
CONCLUSION


Lifestyle intervention resulted a small decrease in plasma LDL cholesterol concentration in children. The effect was explained by changes in quality and quantity of dietary fat and physical activity.

612,32367375,"Prospective randomized clinical trial of open operative, minimally invasive and conservative treatments of acute Achilles tendon tear.","INTRODUCTION


The acute Achilles tendon rupture (AATR) is a common injury of great importance in an increasingly active society. When early functional treatment is established, recent literature shows comparable rates of re-rupture in conservative and surgical treatments of AATR. However, there is no study comparing the outcome using a dynamometer. The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of patients with AATR treated conservatively and surgically using a dynamometer. In addition, the data are compared to evaluation of the Achilles tendon with ultrasound.
MATERIALS AND METHODS


Between 2012 and 2015, 90 patients (mean age 41 years, male-to-female ratio 81:9) with AATR were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, and monocentric study. Thirty patients were assigned to each of the three different treatment groups. Group OPEN received a conventional open suture of the Achilles tendon, group MIN received a minimally invasive suture and patients in group CONS were treated conservatively. Follow-up treatment was the same for all patients regardless of the group they were assigned to. Plantar flexion force was assessed using a dynamometer (Biodex® System 3 Pro, Biodex Medical Systems). Further evaluation included a physical test and ultrasound of the Achilles tendon.
RESULTS


Sixty-nine patients were available for a 24-month follow-up. In each of the OPEN and MIN groups, there was one re-rupture. In the CONS group, there were two re-ruptures. A positive correlation between the Biodex® dynamometer measurement and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot Score (AOFAS-AH) could be found in all groups. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences between the treatment groups after 2 years. On sonography, all patients showed isolated structure loosening and a significantly thickened cross-sectional area compared with the non-injured opposite side, without differences between the groups. There was no correlation between the Biodex® measurement and sonographic outcome.
CONCLUSION


At 24-month follow-up, no significant difference can be found in patients with AATR treated operatively or conservatively. It is, therefore, important to inform patients with AATR regarding the respective advantages and disadvantages of the individual treatment strategies.

613,32367393,Comparison of the standard and triple airway maneuvering techniques for i-gel™ placement in patients undergoing elective surgery: a randomized controlled study.,"PURPOSE


The i-gel is a supraglottic airway device with non-inflatable cuff which can suffer insertion failure if its standard placement technique is implemented. The aim of this study was to compare the placement technique proposed by the manufacturer of i-gel with the triple airway maneuver in terms of successful device insertion time and first-attempt success.
METHODS


After ethics committee approval, 103 ASA I-III patients were randomly allocated to the standard or triple airway maneuver groups. In the standard Group, the i-gel was inserted in the sniffing position while, in the triple group, it was inserted using the triple airway maneuver consisting of head tilt, jaw thrust, and open mouth. The time taken for successful insertion, first-attempt success rate, i-gel position, airway complications, and hemodynamic responses were assessed.
RESULTS


Between the two groups patient characteristics were similar. Time for successful insertion was significantly shorter in the triple group (20 ± 7 s) than with the standard technique (32 ± 11 s; p < 0.001). Successful insertion at the first attempt was 78% and 92% for the standard and triple group, respectively (p = 0.092). The i-gel position, airway complications, and hemodynamic responses were similar in both groups.
CONCLUSION


The triple airway maneuver required less i-gel insertion time as compared with the standard placement technique. First-attempt success rates were similar with both techniques, although the triple airway maneuver was superior to the standard method as a rescue technique in failed insertions. We therefore recommend use of the triple airway maneuver in i-gel insertion.",2020,"First-attempt success rates were similar with both techniques, although the triple airway maneuver was superior to the standard method as a rescue technique in failed insertions.","['patients undergoing elective surgery', '103 ASA I-III patients']",['standard and triple airway maneuvering techniques'],"['time taken for successful insertion, first-attempt success rate, i-gel position, airway complications, and hemodynamic responses', 'Time for successful insertion', 'airway complications, and hemodynamic responses']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0206058', 'cui_str': 'Optional surgery'}, {'cui': 'C4517526', 'cui_str': '103'}, {'cui': 'C0004057', 'cui_str': 'Aspirin'}, {'cui': 'C0439070', 'cui_str': 'III'}]","[{'cui': 'C0038137', 'cui_str': 'standards'}, {'cui': 'C0205174', 'cui_str': 'Triple'}, {'cui': 'C0178987', 'cui_str': 'Airway device'}, {'cui': 'C0025664', 'cui_str': 'methods'}]","[{'cui': 'C0040223', 'cui_str': 'Time'}, {'cui': 'C1515187', 'cui_str': 'Take'}, {'cui': 'C1272703', 'cui_str': 'Successful'}, {'cui': 'C0021107', 'cui_str': 'Implantation procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0017243', 'cui_str': 'Gel'}, {'cui': 'C0733755', 'cui_str': 'Position'}, {'cui': 'C0178987', 'cui_str': 'Airway device'}, {'cui': 'C0009566', 'cui_str': 'Complication'}, {'cui': 'C0019010', 'cui_str': 'Hemodynamics'}]",103.0,0.0395813,"First-attempt success rates were similar with both techniques, although the triple airway maneuver was superior to the standard method as a rescue technique in failed insertions.","[{'ForeName': 'İlkay', 'Initials': 'İ', 'LastName': 'Baran Akkuş', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, University of Health Sciences, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Trainig and Research Hospital, Sehit Ömer Halisdemir Str, 06110, Dıskapı- Altındag, Ankara, Turkey. ilkayb@hotmail.com.'}, {'ForeName': 'Fatma', 'Initials': 'F', 'LastName': 'Kavak Akelma', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, University of Health Sciences, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Trainig and Research Hospital, Sehit Ömer Halisdemir Str, 06110, Dıskapı- Altındag, Ankara, Turkey.'}, {'ForeName': 'Merve', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Emlek', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, University of Health Sciences, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Trainig and Research Hospital, Sehit Ömer Halisdemir Str, 06110, Dıskapı- Altındag, Ankara, Turkey.'}, {'ForeName': 'Derya', 'Initials': 'D', 'LastName': 'Özkan', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, University of Health Sciences, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Trainig and Research Hospital, Sehit Ömer Halisdemir Str, 06110, Dıskapı- Altındag, Ankara, Turkey.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jülide', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Ergil', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, University of Health Sciences, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Trainig and Research Hospital, Sehit Ömer Halisdemir Str, 06110, Dıskapı- Altındag, Ankara, Turkey.'}, {'ForeName': 'Reyhan', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Polat', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, University of Health Sciences, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Trainig and Research Hospital, Sehit Ömer Halisdemir Str, 06110, Dıskapı- Altındag, Ankara, Turkey.'}]",Journal of anesthesia,['10.1007/s00540-020-02780-0']
614,32367400,Length Polymorphisms in the Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Gene and the Serotonin-Transporter-Linked Polymorphic Region Constitute a Risk Haplotype for Depression in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease.,"Genetic variations affecting the course of depressive symptoms in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) have not yet been well studied. Therefore, we set out to investigate whether distinct haplotypes of the two insertion/deletion polymorphisms in the serotonin-transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene located on chromosome 17 can be identified as risk factors for trajectories of depression. Clinical and genotyping data were derived from 507 depressed CAD patients participating in the randomized, controlled, multicenter Stepwise Psychotherapy Intervention for Reducing Risk in Coronary Artery Disease (SPIRR-CAD) trial, of whom the majority had an acute cardiac event before study inclusion. Depression scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were assessed at baseline and at five follow-up time points up to 2 years after study entrance. At baseline, depression scores did not significantly differ between patients carrying the risk haplotype ACE D/D, 5-HTTLPR I/I (n = 46) and the non-risk haplotypes (n = 461, 10.9 ± 2.7 versus 10.4 ± 2.5, p = 0.254). HADS-depression scores declined from study inclusion during the first year irrespective of the genotype. At each follow-up time point, HADS-depression scores were significantly higher in ACE D/D, 5-HTTLPR I/I carriers than in their counterparts. Two years after study inclusion, the mean HADS depression score remained 1.8 points higher in patients with the risk haplotype as compared to subjects not carrying this haplotype (9.9 ± 4.2 versus 8.1 ± 4.0, p = 0.009). In summary, the presence of the ACE D/D, 5-HTTLPR I/I haplotype may be a vulnerability factor for comorbid depressive symptoms in CAD patients.",2020,"At baseline, depression scores did not

615,32367416,Impact of spectral body imaging in patients suspected for occult cancer: a prospective study of 503 patients.,"OBJECTIVES


To investigate the diagnostic impact and performance of spectral dual-layer detector CT in the detection and characterization of cancer compared to conventional CE-CT.
METHODS


In a national workup program for occult cancer, 503 patients (286 females and 217 males) were prospectively enrolled for a contrast-enhanced spectral CT scan. The readings were performed with and without spectral data available. A minimum of 3 months between interpretations was implemented to minimize recall bias. The sequence of reads for the individual patient was randomized. Readers were blinded for patient identifiers and clinical outcome. Two radiologists with 9 and 33 years of experience performed the readings in consensus. If disagreement, a third radiologist with 11 years of experience determined the outcome of the reading RESULTS: Significantly more cancer findings were identified on the spectral reading. In 73 cases of proven cancer, we found a sensitivity of 89% vs 77% and a specificity of 77% vs 83% on spectral CT compared to conventional CT. A slight increase in reading time in spectral images of 82 s was found (382 vs 300, p < 0.001). For all cystic lesions, the perceived diagnostic certainty increased from 30% being completely certain to 96% most pronounced in the kidney, liver, thyroid, and ovaries. And adding the spectral information to the reading gave a decrease in follow-up examination for diagnostic certainty (0.25 vs 0.81 per reading, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION


The use of contrast-enhanced spectral CT increases the confidence of the radiologists in correct characterization of various lesions and minimizes the need for supplementary examinations.

This study aimed to explore the genetic alterations and to identify good responders in the experimental arm in the tumor samples from newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) patients enrolled in JCOG0911; a randomized phase II trial was conducted to compare the efficacy of interferonβ (IFNβ) plus temozolomide (TMZ) with that of TMZ alone.
EXPERIMENTAL


DESIGN: Of 122 tumors, we performed deep targeted sequencing to determine the somatic mutations, copy number variations, and tumor mutation burden; pyrosequencing for O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation; Sanger sequencing for the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter; and microsatellite instability (MSI) testing in 95, 91, 91 and 72 tumors, respectively. We performed a multivariable Cox regression analysis using backward stepwise selection of variables including clinical factors (sex, age, performance status, residual tumor after resection, tumor location) and genetic alterations.
RESULTS


Deep sequencing detected an IDH1 mutation in 13 tumors (14%). The MGMT promoter methylation by quantitative pyrosequencing was observed in 41% of the tumors. A mutation in the TERT promoter was observed in 69% of the tumors. While high tumor mutation burden (> 10 mutations per megabase) was seen in four tumors, none of the tumors displayed MSI-high. The clinical and genetic factors considered as independent favorable prognostic factors were gross total resection (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.49, 95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.81, P = 0.0049) and MGMT promoter methylation (HR: 0.43, 0.21-0.88, P = 0.023). However, tumor location at the temporal lobe (HR: 1.90, 1.22-2.95, P = 0.0046) was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor. No predictive factors specific to the TMZ + IFNβ + Radiotherapy (RT) group were found.

617,32367446,Educational value of telementoring for a simulation-based fundamental use of surgical energy™ (FUSE) curriculum: a randomized controlled trial in surgical trainees.,"INTRODUCTION


The SAGES Fundamental Use of Surgical Energy (FUSE) program accompanied by a bench-top simulation has shown to improve knowledge of the safe use of energy devices. However, there are significant barriers and costs associated with delivering an effective structured simulation curriculum to a widespread international audience. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if bench-top simulation FUSE curriculum through telementoring is as effective as a live-in house proctor for electrosurgical training.
METHODS


A two-armed multi-institutional randomized controlled trial was designed, including a 1-h didactic electrosurgery course (FUSE curriculum), followed by a structured 1-h bench-top simulation training session. For the simulation, participants were randomized to either a live proctor who delivered the course on-site (LIVE group), or a proctor from a remote location using videoconferencing platform (TELEM group). Pre- and post-curriculum (immediate and 6 months) knowledge and self-perceived comfort and competence were assessed. Data are expressed as median [interquartile range], *p < 0.05.
RESULTS


Sixty-five (35 LIVE; 30 TELEM) surgical trainees from three institutions participated. Baseline characteristics were similar. Total score on the exam improved from 47% [40-54] to 78% [71-84]* amongst all participants, with similar immediate post-curriculum scores in the LIVE group compared to the TELEM group (77% [69-83] vs 80% [75-85]). At 6 months, performance on the exam declined significantly for both groups, but remained similar between the two (LIVE: 59% [51-71] vs TELEM: 71% [57-77]). Participants in both groups reported feeling greater comfort and competence post-curriculum (immediate and at 6 months) compared to baseline, with no difference between the two groups.
CONCLUSION


A bench-top simulation FUSE course delivered via a telementoring platform seems to improve surgical trainees' knowledge and comfort in the safe use of electrosurgical devices as effectively as when it is delivered by a live proctor, despite long-term decay for both methods.",2020,"Participants in both groups reported feeling greater comfort and competence post-curriculum (immediate and at 6 months) compared to baseline, with no difference between the two groups.

618,32367561,Salivary Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha to detect the Severity of Erectile Dysfunction: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"AIM


This study aimed to provide evidence on the impact of chronic periodontitis (CP) on the severity of erectile dysfunction (ED) through the assessment of the salivary level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).
METHODS


140 patients with chronic periodontitis and erectile dysfunction were enrolled in this study then randomly allocated to the control group (70 participants received delayed periodontal treatment) or test group (70 participants were subjected to immediate periodontal therapy). The assessment of the clinical and serological outcomes was done at baseline and 3 months postoperatively. This included pocket depth (PD), visible plaque, clinical attachment level (CAL), bleeding on probing (BOP), level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and the severity of erectile dysfunction. Periodontal therapy consists of oral hygiene instructions and single visit scaling and root planning.
RESULTS


there were no significant differences regarding the serological and clinical outcomes at baseline between the two groups (p >0.05). At 3-month follow-up, the PD, BOP, CAL, and visible dental plaque means in the control group were significantly higher than those in the test group (PD: 4.94±0.647 mm vs. 4.25±0.619 mm; BOP: 49.03±29.98 vs. 6.20±7.14; CAL: 4.96±0.631 mm vs. 4.31±0.591 mm; visible dental plaque: 48.49±30.07 vs. 5.83±6.51) (p = 0.00). Compared with baseline findings, both groups showed significant reductions in TNF-α in serum, salivary TNF-α, and severity of erectile dysfunction (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION


The non-surgical periodontal therapy could significantly improve the severity of erectile dysfunction in addition to periodontal and serological parameters.

619,32367611,Accommodative dynamics and attention: the influence of manipulating attentional capacity on accommodative lag and variability.,"PURPOSE


There is evidence that attention can modulate ocular dynamics, but its effects on accommodative dynamics have yet to be fully determined. We investigated the effects of manipulating the capacity to focus on task-relevant stimuli, using two levels of dual-tasking (arithmetic task) and auditory feedback, on the accommodative dynamics at three different target distances (500, 40 and 20 cm).
METHODS


The magnitude and variability of the accommodative response were objectively measured in 20 healthy young adults using the Grand Seiko WAM-5500 autorefractor. In randomised order, participants fixated on a Maltese cross while 1) performing an arithmetic task with two levels of complexity (low and high mental load); 2) being provided with two levels of auditory feedback (low and high feedback); and 3) without performing any mental task or receiving feedback (control). Accommodative and pupil dynamics were monitored for 90 seconds during each of the 15 trials (5 experimental conditions x 3 target distances).
RESULTS


The lag of accommodation was sensitive to the attentional state (p = 0.001), where a lower lag of accommodation was observed for the high feedback condition compared to the control (corrected p-value = 0.009). The imposition of mental load while fixating on a distant target led to a greater accommodative response (corrected p-value = 0.010), but no effects were found for the near targets. There was a main effect of the experimental manipulation on the accommodative variability (p < 0.001), with the use of auditory feedback improving the accuracy of the accommodative system.
CONCLUSIONS


Our data show that accommodative dynamics is affected by varying the capacity to focus on task-relevant stimuli, observing an improvement in accommodative stability and response with auditory feedback. These results highlight an association between attention and ocular dynamics and provide new insight into the control of accommodation.",2020,"The lag of accommodation was sensitive to the attentional state (p = 0.001), where a lower lag of accommodation was observed for the high feedback condition compared to the control (corrected p-value = 0.009).",['20 healthy young adults using the Grand Seiko WAM-5500 autorefractor'],['participants fixated on a Maltese cross while 1) performing an arithmetic task with two levels of complexity (low and high mental load); 2) being provided with two levels of auditory feedback (low and high feedback); and 3) without performing any mental task or receiving feedback (control'],"['accommodative stability and response with auditory feedback', 'lag of accommodation was sensitive to the attentional state', 'lag of accommodation', 'accommodative response', 'accommodative variability', 'dual-tasking (arithmetic task) and auditory feedback', 'Accommodative and pupil dynamics']","[{'cui': 'C0238598', 'cui_str': 'Young Adult'}, {'cui': 'C1275634', 'cui_str': 'Automated infrared optometer'}]","[{'cui': 'C0324395', 'cui_str': 'Maltese dog'}, {'cui': 'C0205203', 'cui_str': 'Crossed'}, {'cui': 'C0884358', 'cui_str': 'Performed'}, {'cui': 'C0441889', 'cui_str': 'Levels'}, {'cui': 'C0205251', 'cui_str': 'Low'}, {'cui': 'C0205250', 'cui_str': 'High'}, {'cui': 'C0439825', 'cui_str': 'Auditory'}, {'cui': 'C0015744', 'cui_str': 'Feedback'}, {'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}]","[{'cui': 'C0205360', 'cui_str': 'Stable'}, {'cui': 'C0439825', 'cui_str': 'Auditory'}, {'cui': 'C0015744', 'cui_str': 'Feedback'}, {'cui': 'C0000936', 'cui_str': 'Ocular accommodation'}, {'cui': 'C0332324', 'cui_str': 'Sensitive'}, {'cui': 'C1301808', 'cui_str': 'State'}, {'cui': 'C1827224', 'cui_str': 'Accommodative response'}, {'cui': 'C0205173', 'cui_str': 'Double'}, {'cui': 'C0034121', 'cui_str': 'Pupil structure'}, {'cui': 'C0729333', 'cui_str': 'Dynamic'}]",20.0,0.0395495,"The lag of accommodation was sensitive to the attentional state (p = 0.001), where a lower lag of accommodation was observed for the high feedback condition compared to the control (corrected p-value = 0.009).","[{'ForeName': 'Beatriz', 'Initials': 'B', 'LastName': 'Redondo', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Optics, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jesús', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Vera', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Optics, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Rubén', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Molina', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Optics, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'Leon N', 'Initials': 'LN', 'LastName': 'Davies', 'Affiliation': 'School of Optometry, Aston University, Birmingham, UK.'}, {'ForeName': 'Raimundo', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Jiménez', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Optics, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.'}]",Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),['10.1111/opo.12690']
620,32367666,"The Impact of Fluoroscopy During Percutaneous Nerve Evaluation on Subsequent Implantation of a Sacral Neuromodulator Among Women With Pelvic Floor Disorders: A Randomized, Noninferiority Trial.","OBJECTIVES


To evaluate whether percutaneous nerve evaluation (PNE) without fluoroscopy is inferior to fluoroscopy use in women undergoing trials of sacral neuromodulation (SNM) for pelvic floor disorders (PFDs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS


In an unblinded noninferiority trial, women undergoing PNE were randomized to fluoroscopy or no fluoroscopy. The primary outcome was ""success"" and defined as implantation of the permanent SNM device within three months of PNE. At an expected 40% success and a 30% noninferiority threshold, 33 participants in each group were needed for 80% power (α = 0.05). Univariate analyses and a logistic regression model adjusting for univariate variables associated with the primary outcome were performed.
RESULTS


From April 2016 to December 2018, 74 participants underwent PNE of which 36 underwent PNE with fluoroscopy and 38 without.

621,32367694,Supplemental oxygen improves exercise capacity in IPF patients with exertional desaturation.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE


The efficacy of supplemental oxygen during exercise remains unclear for patients with IPF, as there have been conflicting results from recent prospective studies with small sample sizes.
METHODS


This prospective, single-blind, randomized, crossover trial evaluated the efficacy of supplemental oxygen compared with placebo air during exercise in consecutive patients with IPF without resting hypoxaemia at initial evaluation. Patients with <90% SpO 2  in a 6MWT using room air were randomly assigned to a CWRET at 80% of peak work rate with oxygen or placebo air gas via nasal cannula at 4 L/min. The primary endpoint was the effect of supplemental oxygen on endurance time.
RESULTS


We recruited 72 consecutive patients (median age: 66.5 years, % FVC: 84.6%, % DL CO  : 61.4%). Supplemental oxygen significantly increased the endurance time (340-424 s; P < 0.001) and minimum SpO 2  (88.0-94.0%; P < 0.001) compared with placebo air. Furthermore, supplemental oxygen significantly improved dyspnoea and leg fatigue. In a multivariate linear regression analysis, the endurance time on air was an independent explanatory variable of the improvement rate of endurance time (P = 0.02).
CONCLUSION


In mild-moderate IPF with exercise-induced hypoxaemia even without resting hypoxaemia, supplemental oxygen during exercise improved the endurance time, desaturation and subjective symptoms.

622,32354952,A Randomized Control Trial of Oral Sucrose Solution for Prevention of Hypoglycemia in High Risk Infants.,"BACKGROUND


Neonatal hypoglycemia is found in up to 15% of neonates and 50% of those with risk factors. Hypoglycemia can cause brain damage and increase risk of developmental delay. Nevertheless, the data regarding hypoglycemia prevention by oral sucrose are still limited. The present study aimed to investigate whether oral sucrose solution can prevent hypoglycemia in high-risk infants.
PATIENTS AND METHODS


Four hundred and twenty-five infants with high hypoglycemic risk were randomized into two groups (214 infants in the intervention and 211 infants in the control groups). The intervention group received one dose of 0.8 ml/kg of 24% oral sucrose solution followed by enteral feed and was compared to the control group receiving enteral feed alone. Glucose levels were evaluated by Dextrostrix.
RESULTS


There was no significant difference in antenatal and perinatal risk factors of neonatal hypoglycemia between groups. Glucose level on admission was 72.1±20.3 and 72.1±24.1 mg/dl in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Although no significant difference was recognized in terms of capillary blood glucose levels between groups, data analysis revealed that the glucose increase over time was significantly higher in the intervention group at 1 h (mean±SE=3.61±1.27 mg/dl; p<0.005), 3 h (mean±SE=7.95±1.57 mg/dl, p<0.001), and 6 h (mean±SE=6.31±1.62 mg/dl, p<0.001) in comparison to those of the control. No serious adverse event was observed in either group.
CONCLUSION

624,32355503,"The SENIEUR protocol and the efficacy of hepatitis B vaccination in healthy elderly persons by age, gender, and vaccine route.","Background


Reduced response to hepatitis B vaccines is associated with aging, confounding and comorbid conditions, as well as inadvertent subcutaneous (SC) inoculation. We hypothesized that the antibody and T cell-mediated immune responses (T-CMI) of elderly adults to a vaccine intended for intramuscular (IM) administration would be attenuated when deposited into SC fat, independent of confounding conditions.
Results


Fifty-two healthy, community dwelling elderly adults (65-82 years), seronegative for HBV, were enrolled in the SENIEUR protocol as a strictly healthy population. These seniors were randomized to receive a licensed alum-adjuvanted recombinant HBV vaccine either SC or IM, with the inoculum site verified by imaging. The response rates, defined as hepatitis B surface antibodies (HBsAb) ≥10 IU/L, were significantly lower in the elderly than in young adults, a group of 12, healthy, 21-34-year-old volunteers. Moreover, elderly participants who received the vaccine IM were significantly more likely to be responders than those immunized SC (54% versus 16%,  p  = 0.008). The low seroconversion rate in the IM group progressively declined with increasing age, and responders had significantly lower HBsAb titers and limited isotype responses. Moreover, T-CMI (proliferation and cytokine production) were significantly reduced in both percentage of responders and intensity of the response for both Th1 and Th2 subsets in the elderly.
Conclusions


Our data demonstrate the blunted immunogenicity of SC inoculation as measured by peak titers and response rates. Further, the qualitative and quantitative deficits in B- and T-CMI responses to primary alum adjuvanted protein antigens persisted even in strictly healthy elderly populations with verified IM placement compared to younger populations.

625,32355565,A cognitive remediation training for young adults with psychotic disorders to support their participation in education - study protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial.,"Background


Most severe mental disorders have their onset between the age of 17 and 27, a time when many young adults begin participating in secondary or post-secondary education. The cognitive deficits typically associated with psychiatric disorders, especially psychotic disorders, increase the risk of leaving school early, which can lead to a reduction in employment opportunities later on in life and, in turn, a poorer long-term prognosis. Therefore, specific interventions aiming to improve these cognitive functions are needed. Cognitive remediation (CR) aims to improve cognitive functioning and may increase real-world functioning in educational performance. This study aims to examine the feasibility and applicability of a CR training named Mindset for students with psychotic disorders in the Netherlands.
Methods/design


Sixty students diagnosed with a psychotic disorder and currently reporting cognitive deficits will be included from four Dutch Mental Health Care institutes. Half of the participants ( N  = 30) will be randomly assigned to the CR training consisting of twelve, individual, weekly 1-h meetings. The other half will be assigned to an active control condition consisting of twelve weekly assignments that will be sent by email aiming to improve school performance. Students will be evaluated at baseline (T0), directly after finishing the CR training or control intervention (T1), and 6 months later (T2). Treatment feasibility will be the primary outcome, using evaluation forms, interviews with trainers and participants, number of study drop outs, and patient eligibility and recruitment rates. School functioning, cognitive functioning, and strategy use will also be assessed to get a preliminary idea of the potential effectiveness of the intervention.
Discussion


The CR training in this study will provide real-world examples and exercises aimed to teach useful strategies to cope with the cognitive deficits experienced by students with psychotic disorders. Furthermore, since students with other psychiatric disorders might also experience cognitive deficits, the results of this study may also provide some further implications for future studies on the effect of this CR training for students with these disorders.

626,32355566,Study protocol for a cluster randomised controlled feasibility trial evaluating personalised care planning for older people with frailty: PROSPER V2 27/11/18.,"Background


Frailty is characterised by increased vulnerability to falls, disability, hospitalisation and care home admission. However, it is relatively reversible in the early stages. Older people living with frailty often have multiple health and social issues which are difficult to address but could benefit from proactive, person-centred care. Personalised care planning aims to improve outcomes through better self-management, care coordination and access to community resources.
Methods


This feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial aims to recruit 400 participants from 11 general practice clusters across Bradford and Leeds in the north of England. Eligible patients will be aged over 65 with an electronic frailty index score of 0.21 (identified via their electronic health record), living in their own homes, without severe cognitive impairment and not in receipt of end of life care. After screening for eligible patients, a restricted 1:1 cluster-level randomisation will be used to allocate practices to the PROSPER intervention, which will be delivered over 12 weeks by a personal independence co-ordinator worker, or usual care. Following initial consent, participants will complete a baseline questionnaire in their own home including measures of health-related quality of life, activities of daily living, depression and health and social care resource use. Follow-up will be at six and 12 months. Feasibility outcomes relate to progression criteria based around recruitment, intervention delivery, retention and follow-up. An embedded process evaluation will contribute to iterative intervention optimisation and logic model development by examining staff training, intervention implementation and contextual factors influencing delivery and uptake of the intervention.
Discussion


Whilst personalised care planning can improve outcomes in long-term conditions, implementation in routine settings is poor. We will evaluate the feasibility of conducting a cluster randomised controlled trial of personalised care planning in a community population based on frailty status. Key objectives will be to test fidelity of trial design, gather data to refine sample size calculation for the planned definitive trial, optimise data collection processes and optimise the intervention including training and delivery.

627,32355569,The effects of the integration of an economic strengthening and HIV prevention education programme on the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections and savings behaviours among adolescents: a full-factorial randomised controlled trial in South Africa.,"Background


Multisectoral approaches are thought necessary to prevent HIV among adolescents. We examined whether an economic strengthening (ES) and an HIV-prevention education intervention improved outcomes when combined versus separately.
Methods


We conducted a full-factorial randomised controlled study to randomise participants into all possible intervention groups based on the two interventions: economic strengthening only (ES-only), HIV-prevention only (HIV-only), both interventions combined (ES+HIV) and no intervention (control). We measured sexually transmitted infections (STIs), self-reported economic and sexual behaviours/knowledge, and pregnancy at a pre-intervention and two post-intervention assessments. Eligible participants were adolescents 14 to 17 years old from a programme supporting vulnerable families in Gauteng Province, South Africa. We estimated intervention effects using repeated measures, generalised linear mixed models.
Results


A total of 1773 adolescents participated (57% female). ES+HIV adolescents had the lowest STI prevalence at first endline; however, the comparison with the control was not significant (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.41). ES-only or HIV-only groups were not significantly better than the control on STI prevalence (OR 1.53, 95% CI 0.73 to 3.20 and OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.69 to 3.12, respectively). STI prevalence became more similar among the groups at second endline.ES-only adolescents were more likely to participate in savings groups (p=0.004) and plan to save for education (p=0.001) versus the control. ES+HIV adolescents were more likely to plan to save for education versus the control (p=0.001) and HIV-only groups (p=0.002) but did not differ significantly from the ES-only group (p=0.803). The ES+HIV intervention's effect on HIV knowledge was significant compared with the control (p=0.03) and ES-only groups (p<0.001), but not when compared with the HIV-only group (p=0.091). Effects on pregnancy, sexual behaviours or other economic behaviours were not significant.
Conclusions


We could not confirm the ES and HIV interventions, separately or combined, were effective to reduce STI prevalence. Evaluations of multicomponent interventions should use full-factorial designs to fully assess effects.

628,32356074,"A Randomized, Controlled, Pilot Study of CPAP for Patients with Chronic Cough and Obstructive Sleep Apnea.","BACKGROUND


An association between chronic cough and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been reported in prior studies with resolution or improvement in cough after continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. Controlled studies of the benefit of CPAP on cough-quality of life measures have not been conducted.
RESEARCH QUESTION


Does CPAP therapy for OSA improve cough in patients with chronic unexplained cough?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS


Patients with unexplained chronic cough (> 2 months duration of cough) and OSA were randomized to receive either CPAP or sham CPAP therapy for 6 weeks. The primary end point was the change in health status assessed with the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) in patients treated with CPAP vs. sham CPAP. Secondary end points were changes in exhaled breath condensate markers of airway inflammation (interleukin-6, nitrite/nitrates, hydrogen peroxide and 8-isoprostanes).
RESULTS


A total of 22 patients with chronic unexplained cough and OSA were randomized of whom18 completed 6 weeks of treatments with either CPAP or sham CPAP. The CPAP vs. sham CPAP-treated group were comparable in terms of sex distribution, body mass index, and OSA severity. Following CPAP therapy, there was a significantly greater improvement in total LCQ scores as compared to those treated with sham therapy (ANCOVA p value 0.016). No significant differences were noted in the exhaled breath condensate marker changes between CPAP-treated vs. sham CPAP-treated groups.
CONCLUSION


Treatment of comorbid OSA in patients with chronic cough improved cough quality of life measures following treatment of OSA with CPAP in this pilot study. Larger studies to understand this association and unravel mechanisms of CPAP benefit in chronic cough need to be undertaken.

629,32356084,Is Essentialism Essential? Reducing Homonegative Prejudice by Targeting Diverse Sexual Orientation Beliefs.,"We conducted an experiment to assess whether targeting multiple beliefs about sexual orientation (SO) may be more effective in reducing homonegativity than focusing only on beliefs about its biogenetic origins. Participants (116 women, 85 men) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions or a control condition. Those in the treatment conditions read essays summarizing: (1) research suggesting SO has biogenetic origins, (2) research suggesting SO is socially constructed and refuting beliefs about the discreteness, homogeneity, and informativeness of SO categories; or (3) research suggesting SO is biogenetic and research suggesting SO categories are socially constructed and not necessarily discrete, homogenous, or informative. We predicted participants in the conditions that targeted multiple beliefs related to the social construction of SO, not just its biogenetic origins, would exhibit the strongest reductions in beliefs about the discreteness, homogeneity, and informativeness of SO categories, and in homonegativity. We also predicted these participants would exhibit the greatest increases in support for gay and lesbian civil rights. We observed hypothesized shifts in SO beliefs across all experimental conditions.

630,32356108,Prospective randomized controlled study for comparison of 2-dimensional versus 3-dimensional laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma.,"BACKGROUND


Due to the technological advance in resolution and stereoscopic depth, the 3-dimensional (3D) laparoscopic system has been widely used in real surgery. However, there have been few studies to confirm the clinical usefulness of the 3D laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG). This study aimed to compare perioperative outcomes between the 2-dimensional (2D) and 3D LDG for gastric cancer patients.
METHODS


This was a prospective, randomized controlled, single-center, and superiority trial. This study was carried in Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. Patients with histologically confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma which could be radically resected by LDG were randomly assigned (1:1) to the 2D or 3D group. From October 2016 to August 2018, 84 patients were included in this study and randomly assigned into the 2D group (44 patients) or the 3D group (40 patients). A total of 5 patients were excluded; 3 in the 2D group and 2 were in the 3D group. Consequently, the data from 79 patients were analyzed (2D: 41 cases; 3D: 38 cases). For the LDG procedure, 3D and 2D camera and display system were applied according to the assigned group. The primary end point was the duration of total laparoscopic operation time. Secondary end points included the amount of intraoperative blood loss (IBL), the number of harvested lymph nodes, postoperative complications and open conversion rate.
RESULTS


There were no differences between 2 and 3D groups with respect to clinicopathologic characteristics. The total operation time in 3D groups was significantly shorter than 2D group (122 [106.5-161] versus 101 [77.75-125.5] minutes; P = 0.001). The postoperative complication rates in the 3D groups was significantly lower than 2D group (24.4% versus 7.9%, respectively; P = 0.045).
CONCLUSION


3D LDG shorten the operation time compared with 2D LDG in gastric cancer patients. And 3D laparoscopy provided the benefit of less postoperative complications.

This post hoc analysis explored relationships between prospectively identified baseline characteristics [poor prognostic factors (PPFs) ] and response to abatacept. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive subcutaneous abatacept 125 mg weekly or placebo for 24 weeks; those without ≥ 20% improvement in joint counts at Week 16 switched to open-label abatacept. Potential predictors of ACR20 response were identified by treatment arm using multivariate analyses. Likelihood of ACR20 response to abatacept versus placebo was compared in univariate and multivariate analyses in subgroups stratified by the PPF, as defined by EULAR and/or GRAPPA treatment guidelines. Odds ratios (ORs) were generated using logistic regression to identify meaningful differences (OR cut-off: 1.2). 424 patients were randomized and treated (abatacept n = 213; placebo n = 211). In abatacept-treated patients, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), high Disease Activity Score based on 28 joints (CRP), presence of dactylitis, and ≥ 3 joint erosions were identified as predictors of response (OR > 1.2). In placebo-treated patients, only dactylitis was a potential predictor of response. In the univariate analysis stratified by PPF, ACR20 response was more likely (OR > 1.2) with abatacept versus placebo in patients with baseline PPFs than in those without; multivariate analysis confirmed this finding.

632,32356170,"A prospective, comparative study of subacromial corticosteroid injection and subacromial corticosteroid injection plus suprascapular nerve block in patients with shoulder impingement syndrome.","INTRODUCTION


Efforts are recently focused on the management of shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS) with a conservative and targeted approach because of its psychosocial impact, reduction in the quality of life, the cost to the economy and its negative effect on daily activities. Therefore, many studies have been designed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different treatments. The main purpose of this study was to identify the effect of combination of subacromial corticosteroid injection (SCI) and suprascapular nerve block (SSNB) on shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS


66 patients with SIS were randomly divided into two groups (33 patients per group): Group 1: SCI; Group 2: SCI plus SSNB. The estimation of the severity of pain by the visual analogue scale (VAS) and shoulder disability using quick DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) were assessed at baseline and 1, 3 months post-injection.
RESULTS


The mean age of patients was 55.55 ± 10.42 years in Group 1 and 57.24 ± 12.75 years in Group 2. In steroid group, pre- and post-treatment (at 1 and 3 months) VAS/quickDASH scores were 8.64 ± 0.99/78.03 ± 9.24, 2.09 ± 0.84/15.58 ± 7.23 and 3.06 ± 1.12/25.06 ± 8.74, respectively. In steroid plus SSNB group, pre- and post-treatment (at 1 and 3 months) VAS/quickDASH scores were 8.45 ± 0.90/75.15 ± 9.86, 1.24 ± 0.43/10.88 ± 2.14 and 1.51 ± 0.56/15.51 ± 5.04, respectively. Both treatment groups showed a significant relief of pain at 1 and 3 months post-injection (p < 0.05). However, the VAS and quickDASH scores at 1 and 3 months were significantly lower in Group 2 versus Group 1 (p < 0.05).

633,32356416,Influence of Besifovir Dipivoxil Maleate Combined with L-Carnitine on Hepatic Steatosis in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B.,"BACKGROUND


Besifovir dipivoxil maleate (BSV) with L-carnitine is the first-line antiviral agent for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection. We investigated whether BSV combined with L-carnitine improves hepatic steatosis (HS).
METHODS


Treatment-naïve patients with CHB who were initiated on antiviral therapy (AVT) were enrolled. The magnitude of HS was assessed using hepatic steatosis index (HSI), and HS improvement was defined as a ≥ 10% reduction in the HSI score from the baseline.
RESULTS


The mean age of the study patients was 56 years with a male predominance (n = 178, 64.7%). The mean body mass index (BMI), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and platelet count were 23.5 kg/m², 49.6 IU/L, 49.0 IU/L, and 191.3 × 10⁹/L, respectively. The mean HSI and fibrosis (FIB)-4 index were 32.6 and 0.5, respectively. After 6 months of AVT, platelet count (mean, 191.3→167.0 × 10⁹/L), fasting glucose (mean, 113.1→105.9 mg/dL), AST (mean, 49.6→28.0 IU/L), ALT (mean, 49.0→33.9 IU/L), and total cholesterol (mean, 170.0→162.1 mg/dL) levels significantly decreased (all  P  < 0.05). In the BSV group, AST (mean, 95.2→30.2 IU/L) and ALT (mean, 81.1→31.1 IU/L) levels significantly reduced (all  P  < 0.05), whereas HSI and FIB-4 index were maintained (all  P  > 0.05). In the univariate analysis, age, BMI, diabetes, cirrhosis, fasting glucose level, and ALT were significantly associated with HS improvement (all  P  < 0.05).

635,32356470,Postoperative analgesia and opioid use following hip arthroscopy with ultrasound-guided quadratus lumborum block: a randomized controlled double-blind trial.,"OBJECTIVE


To investigate the postoperative analgesic effect of ultrasound-guided quadratus lumborum block (QLB) in patients undergoing arthroscopic hip surgery.
METHODS


Patients who were scheduled to undergo elective arthroscopic hip surgery were randomly assigned to the QLB (Q) or control (C) group (n = 40 each). After general anesthesia induction, unilateral QLB was performed under ultrasound guidance in the Q group. The amount of opioid use via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and the resting and movement pain visual analog scale (VAS) scores when the patient left the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after surgery were recorded. Postoperative complications were recorded for both groups.
RESULTS


At 24 hours post-surgery, opioid consumption amounts via PCA (48.4 [48.1-48.6] mL) in the Q group were significantly lower compared with the C group (52.0 [51.0-53.8] mL). A significant reduction in opioid consumption was observed between the two groups at each time point. Resting and movement VAS scores at each time point were significantly lower in the Q compared with the C group.
CONCLUSIONS


Hip arthroscopy patients who received QLB and general anesthesia in combination had less pain and a lower opioid requirement within 24 hours postoperatively.",2020,"Resting and movement VAS scores at each time point were significantly lower in the Q compared with the C group.

636,32367748,Clinical efficacy of Baihe Gujin decoction combined with anti-tuberculosis therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis with Yin-deficiency and Fire-hyperactivity syndrome.,"OBJECTIVE


To evaluate the clinical efficacy of Baihe Gujin decoction combined with anti-tuberculosis therapy in mitigating the symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis and to measure the effect on the CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cell (T reg ) ratio.
METHODS


This randomized study enrolled patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and randomly assigned them to one of two treatment groups: an anti-tuberculosis treatment group and a combined treatment group. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed before and 2 weeks after treatment. The ratio of CD4+ CD25+ T reg  cells and the levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6 and IL-12 in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were measured. Symptoms were recorded before and after treatment.
RESULTS


A total of 100 patients were enrolled and assigned to the anti-tuberculosis ( n  = 58) and combined treatment groups ( n  = 42). In the combined treatment group, Leicester Cough Questionnaire score, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CD4+ CD25+ T reg  cell ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, cytokine levels, chest pain score and sleep disorder score were significantly decreased compared with the anti-tuberculosis treatment group after treatment. The leukocyte count, haemoglobin level, platelet and alanine aminotransferase levels did not differ significantly between the two groups after treatment. The creatinine level in the combined treatment group was significantly lower than that in the anti-tuberculosis treatment group.

637,32367786,A pilot feasibility study of a group-delivered cancer parenting program: Enhancing Connections-Group.,"Objective:  The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and short-term impact of a 5-session fully manualized, group-delivered cancer parenting education program to diagnosed parents or surrogate parents with a school-age child. Design:  Single group, pre-post-test design with intent to treat analysis. Sample:  A total of 16 parents completed the program who were diagnosed within 12 months with non-metastatic cancer of any type (Stages 0-III), read and wrote English, had a child 5-17 years old who knew the parent's diagnosis. Methods:  Assessments occurred at baseline and at 2 months post-baseline on standardized measures of parental depressed mood, anxiety, parenting self-efficacy, parenting quality, parenting skills and child behavioral-emotional adjustment. Findings/Results:  The program was feasible and well accepted: 16/18 (89%) of the enrolled participants were included in the intent to treat analysis. Program staff were consistently positive and enthusiastic about the demonstrated skills they observed in group attendees during the group-delivered sessions, including the emergence of support between attendees. Outcomes on all measures improved between baseline and post-intervention; changes were statistically significant on measures of parents' anxiety, parents' self-efficacy, parents' skills, and parenting quality. Conclusions:  The group-delivered Enhancing Connections cancer parenting program has potential to improve behavioral-emotional outcomes on standardized measures of skills and emotional adjustment in parents, parent-surrogates and children.

Shivering is a frequent undesirable event in patients undergoing cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia. Postanesthetic shivering has a multitude of deleterious effects and different methods have been used to prevent it. We therefore compare the efficacy of ondansetron to that of tramadol in preventing postanesthetic shivering in women undergoing cesarean section under subarachnoid block.
Aim


Comparison of the efficacy of ondansetron to that of tramadol in preventing postanesthetic shivering in women undergoing cesarean section under subarachnoid block.
Subject and Methods


This is a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. The patients (n = 109) were randomly allocated to three groups according to the study drugs, namely tramadol 50 mg group (Group T), ondansetron 4 mg group (Group O), and saline 4 ml group (Group S) using envelope randomization. Statistical analyses were done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences 20.0.
Results


A total of 100 patients completed the study (33 in Group S, 33 in Group T, and 34 in Group O). The three groups were comparable with respect to demographic characteristics. Shivering was observed in 16 (48.5%) of the patients in Group S; 13 (39.4%) patients in Group T, and in only 2 (5.9%) patients in Group O. The differences in incidence of shivering were statistically significant between Groups O and S (P = 0.000) and Groups O and T (P = 0.001) but not between Groups T and S (P = 0.460). The differences across the groups were not statistically significant in terms of incidence of intraoperative hypotension, bradycardia, and the cumulative amount of ephedrine consumed.

639,32367870,Misoprostol versus manual vacuum aspiration for treatment of first-trimester incomplete miscarriage in a low-resource setting: A randomized controlled trial.,"Background


Manual vacuum aspiration is a safe and effective technology for the treatment of incomplete miscarriage but it is not widely available and affordable in rural areas particularly in low-resource countries. Misoprostol is an alternative to manual vacuum aspiration for the treatment of incomplete miscarriage.
Aim


To compare the effectiveness, client acceptability and satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness of misoprostol with manual vacuum aspiration for the treatment of the first-trimester incomplete miscarriage.
Subjects and Methods


This study was conducted between February 1, 2018 and August 31, 2018 at Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital Abakaliki, Nigeria. 100 participants were randomized to treatment with either manual vacuum aspiration or 600 μg oral misoprostol. The main outcome measures assessed at 1-week follow-up were complete uterine evacuation, client acceptability and satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. Sociodemographic characteristics, treatment outcomes and other variables were summarized by descriptive statistics. Chi-square test was used for comparison between groups as regard categorical data while Student's't' test was used for comparison between groups for continuous data. P value of <0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.
Results


There was a higher failure rate in the misoprostol arm when compared with MVA. Although this difference in complete uterine evacuation rate did not reach statistical significance (81.3% versus 95.7%, RR = 4.3, 95% CI 0.98-18.9, P value = 0.05), more participants in the misoprostol arm would choose the method again when compared with women in the MVA group (47 versus 30, X [2]  = 16.95, P < 0.001). The mean client satisfaction score was significantly higher among women in the misoprostol arm compared to MVA group (13.2 (2.1) versus 7.3 (4.6), P < 0.001). The mean cost of primary treatment was higher in the MVA group compared with misoprostol arm ($67.8 (8.9) versus 14.4 (4.0), P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the mean cost of repeat uterine evacuation in both study arms (MVA, $64.9 (6.3) versus misoprostol, $65.76 (6.6), P = 0.86).
Conclusion


Although medical treatment was associated with a higher failure rate, there was no statistically significant difference in the effectiveness of both treatment methods.

640,32356581,Diabetic retinopathy progression 6 months post cataract surgery with intravitreous bevacizumab vs triamc1inolone: A secondary analysis of the DiMECAT trial.,"IMPORTANCE


Diabetic retinopathy (DR) may progress following cataract surgery due to surgery-induced inflammation. The effect of intravitreal bevacizumab (BVB) and triamcinolone acetonide (TCA), which have differing anti-inflammatory properties, on DR progression following cataract surgery has not been reported.
BACKGROUND


To report the progression of DR in diabetic patients undergoing cataract extraction treated with intravitreal BVB or TCA during the surgery.
DESIGN


Post-hoc analysis of 6 month data from a prospective, randomized, double-masked clinical trial PARTICIPANTS: Diabetic patients with clinically significant cataract and fovea involving diabetic macular oedema (DME), or a recent history of DME.
METHODS


Participants were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive intravitreal BVB 1.25 mg or TCA 4 mg during and post cataract surgery as needed. The rate of DR progression between groups was compared.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)


DR progression RESULTS: There were 61 eyes included. Patients receiving BVB were older than those receiving TCA (70.2 vs 64.3 years; P < 0.05). Three participants (10.7%) in the BVB and three (9.09%) in the TCA group had a 1-step progression, while none in BVB and only one (3%) in the TCA group demonstrated 2-step DR progression. In the majority of these patients, DR progression was from mild to moderate NPDR.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE


In this study, BVB and TCA groups had a similar, and lower rate of DR progression compared to previous studies where no adjunctive treatment was administered, suggesting that patients with DME may benefit from either intra-operative intravitreous BVB or TCA injection to reduce the risk of DR progression following cataract surgery.

642,32356592,'It just wasn't going to be heard': A mixed methods study to compare different ways of involving people with diabetes and health-care professionals in health intervention research.,"BACKGROUND


Guidelines recommend involving intervention users in the intervention development process. However, there is limited guidance on how to involve users in a meaningful and effective way.
OBJECTIVE


The aim of this Study within a trial was to compare participants' experiences of taking part in one of three types of consensus meetings-people with diabetes-only, combined people with diabetes and health-care professionals (HCPs) or HCP-only meeting.
DESIGN


The study used a mixed methods convergent design. Quantitative (questionnaire) and qualitative (observation notes and semi-structured telephone interviews) data were collected to explore participants' experiences. A triangulation protocol was used to compare quantitative and qualitative findings.
PARTICIPANTS


People with diabetes (recruited via multiple strategies) were randomly assigned to attend the people with diabetes or combined meeting. HCPs (recruited through professional networks) attended the HCP or combined meeting based on their availability.
RESULTS


Sixteen people with diabetes and 15 HCPs attended meetings, of whom 18 participated in a telephone interview. Participants' questionnaire responses suggested similar positive experiences across the three meetings. Observation and semi-structured interviews highlighted differences experienced by participants in the combined meeting relating to: perceived lack of common ground; feeling empowered versus undervalued; needing to feel safe and going off task to fill the void.
CONCLUSIONS

643,32356609,Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"BACKGROUND


Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with cough, sputum production or dyspnoea, and a reduction in lung function, quality of life, and life expectancy. Apart from smoking cessation, no other treatments that slow lung function decline are available. Roflumilast and cilomilast are oral phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE₄) inhibitors proposed to reduce the airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction seen in COPD. This Cochrane Review was first published in 2011, and was updated in 2017 and 2020.
OBJECTIVES


To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral PDE₄ inhibitors for management of stable COPD.
SEARCH METHODS


We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register (date of last search 9 March 2020). We found other trials at web-based clinical trials registers.
SELECTION CRITERIA


We included RCTs if they compared oral PDE₄ inhibitors with placebo in people with COPD. We allowed co-administration of standard COPD therapy.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS


We used standard Cochrane methods. Two independent review authors selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We resolved discrepancies by involving a third review author. We assessed our confidence in the evidence by using GRADE recommendations. Primary outcomes were change in lung function (minimally important difference (MID) = 100 mL) and quality of life (scale 0 to 100; higher score indicates more limitations).
MAIN RESULTS


We found 42 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analyses for roflumilast (28 trials with 18,046 participants) or cilomilast (14 trials with 6457 participants) or tetomilast (1 trial with 84 participants), with a duration between six weeks and one year or longer. These trials included people across international study centres with moderate to very severe COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grades II to IV), with mean age of 64 years. We judged risks of selection bias, performance bias, and attrition bias as low overall amongst the 39 published and unpublished trials. Lung function Treatment with a PDE₄ inhibitor was associated with a small, clinically insignificant improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) over a mean of 40 weeks compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) 49.33 mL, 95% confidence interval (CI) 44.17 to 54.49; participants = 20,815; studies = 29; moderate-certainty evidence). Forced vital capacity (FVC) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were also improved over 40 weeks (FVC: MD 86.98 mL, 95% CI 74.65 to 99.31; participants = 22,108; studies = 17; high-certainty evidence; PEF: MD 6.54 L/min, 95% CI 3.95 to 9.13; participants = 4245; studies = 6; low-certainty evidence). Quality of life Trials reported improvements in quality of life over a mean of 33 weeks (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) MD -1.06 units, 95% CI -1.68 to -0.43; participants = 7645 ; moderate-certainty evidence). Incidence of exacerbations Treatment with a PDE₄ inhibitor was associated with a reduced likelihood of COPD exacerbation over a mean of 40 weeks (odds ratio (OR) 0.78, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.84; participants = 20,382; studies = 27; high-certainty evidence), that is, for every 100 people treated with PDE₄ inhibitors, five more remained exacerbation-free during the study period compared with those given placebo (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 20, 95% CI 16 to 27). No change in COPD-related symptoms nor in exercise tolerance was found. Adverse events More participants in the treatment groups experienced an adverse effect compared with control participants over a mean of 39 weeks (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.38; participants = 21,310; studies = 30; low-certainty evidence). Participants experienced a range of gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, or dyspepsia. Diarrhoea was more commonly reported with PDE₄ inhibitor treatment (OR 3.20, 95% CI 2.74 to 3.50; participants = 20,623; studies = 29; high-certainty evidence), that is, for every 100 people treated with PDE₄ inhibitors, seven more suffered from diarrhoea during the study period compared with those given placebo (number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 15, 95% CI 13 to 17). The likelihood of psychiatric adverse events was higher with roflumilast 500 µg than with placebo (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.54; participants = 11,168; studies = 15 (COPD pool data); moderate-certainty evidence). Roflumilast in particular was associated with weight loss during the trial period and with an increase in insomnia and depressive mood symptoms. Participants treated with PDE₄ inhibitors were more likely to withdraw from trial participation; on average, 14% in the treatment groups withdrew compared with 8% in the control groups. Mortality No effect on mortality was found (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.24; participants = 19,786; studies = 27; moderate-certainty evidence), although mortality was a rare event during these trials.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS


For this current update, five new studies from the 2020 search contributed to existing findings but made little impact on outcomes described in earlier versions of this review. PDE₄ inhibitors offered a small benefit over placebo in improving lung function and reducing the likelihood of exacerbations in people with COPD; however, they had little impact on quality of life or on symptoms. Gastrointestinal adverse effects and weight loss were common, and the likelihood of psychiatric symptoms was higher, with roflumilast 500 µg. The findings of this review provide cautious support for the use of PDE₄ inhibitors in COPD. In accordance with GOLD 2020 guidelines, they may have a place as add-on therapy for a subgroup of people with persistent symptoms or exacerbations despite optimal COPD management (e.g. people whose condition is not controlled by fixed-dose long-acting beta₂-agonist (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combinations). More longer-term trials are needed to determine whether or not PDE₄ inhibitors modify FEV₁ decline, hospitalisation, or mortality in COPD.",2020,"Lung function Treatment with a PDE₄ inhibitor was associated with a small, clinically insignificant improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) over a mean of 40 weeks compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) 49.33 mL, 95% confidence interval (CI) 44.17 to 54.49;

MATERIAL AND METHODS


We examined 150 patients with II - IV stage osteoarthritis of the knee and hip joints, movement pain of more than 40 mm on a VAS and Leken index more than 9. 120 of these patients received a course of CT of various temperatures and cryo-SMC for 2 weeks: 1st group ( n =30) - CT of ice 0 °C; 2nd group ( n =30) - cryo-SMC; 3rd group ( n =30) - ACT; 4th group ( n =30) - HC. The 5th group (control) included patients ( n =30) who received only non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We assessed dynamics of rest and movement pain according to VAS, the WOMAC index, the effectiveness according to the OMERACT-OARSI criterion and the need for NSAIDs. Effectiveness of treatment was evaluated by the patient and the doctor.
RESULTS


OMERACT-OARSI analysis demonstrated a high percentage of CT response. A statistically significant decrease in rest and movement pain intensity was registered in all patients of the groups: ice 0 °C, cryo-SMC, ACT, HC and control groups. The pain decreased by 82-83% in the groups 1-4, and by 70% in the control group. There were no differences in the effectiveness of treatment between groups 1, 3, and 4 and the cryo-SMC group; effectiveness of treatment was statistically significant ( p <0.01) between groups 1-4 and the control group. A statistically significant decrease in the total WOMAC index, as well as in «pain» and «stiffness» VAS subscales ( p <0.01) in the absence of intergroup differences in the 1st, 3rd, 4th groups and the cryo-SMC ( p >0.05) group and a statistically significant difference between the 1st-4th groups and the control group ( p <0.01).

The phase III COMPASS trial demonstrated that treatment with rivaroxaban vascular dose 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin (dual pathway inhibition [DPI] regimen) significantly reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (including peripheral ischemic events) and increased the risk of major bleeding, but not fatal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage, versus aspirin alone in patients with CAD, PAD, or both. The results of the COMPASS trial supported the regulatory approval of the DPI regimen in several geographic regions. However, it is unclear whether the patients selected for treatment with the DPI regimen in clinical practice will have a similar risk profile and event rates compared with the COMPASS trial population. The prospective post-approval XATOA registry study aims to assess treatment patterns, as well as ischemic and bleeding outcomes in patients with CAD, PAD, or both, who receive DPI therapy in routine clinical practice.

647,32125874,Do Ambient Ozone or Other Pollutants Modify Effects of Controlled Ozone Exposure on Pulmonary Function?,"Rationale:  In a previous trial (MOSES [Multicenter Ozone Study of oldEr Subjects]), 3 hours of controlled ozone (O 3 ) exposure caused concentration-related reductions in lung function with evidence of airway inflammation and injury, but without convincing evidence of effects on cardiovascular function. However, the subjects' exposures to indoor and outdoor air pollution in the hours and days before each controlled O 3  exposure may have modified biomarker responses to the controlled O 3  exposures. Objectives:  We sought to determine whether personal measures of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and O 3 , or ambient concentrations of O 3 , particulate matter ≤2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter, NO 2 , carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) in the 72 and 96 hours before the exposure visit modified biomarker responses to controlled O 3  exposure. Methods:  MOSES subjects were exposed for 3 hours in random order to clean air containing 0 ppb O 3 , 70 ppb O 3 , or 120 ppm O 3 , alternating 15 minutes of moderate exercise with 15 minutes of rest. Cardiovascular and pulmonary endpoints (biomarkers of autonomic function, repolarization, ST segment change, arrhythmia, prothrombotic vascular status, systemic inflammation, vascular function, pulmonary function, oxidative stress, and lung injury) were measured on the day before, the day of, and up to 22 hours after each exposure. We evaluated whether ambient pollutant concentrations in the 96 hours before the pre-exposure visit modified pre- to post-exposure lung function biomarker responses to the controlled O 3  exposures, using tertiles of passive personal exposure samplers (PES) of O 3  and NO 2 , ambient air pollutant concentrations, and mixed effects linear regression. We also similarly explored the effect modification of controlled O 3  effects on biomarkers of other MOSES outcome groups in the same way. Although we used  P  < 0.01 to define statistical significance, we did not formally correct for multiple comparisons. Results:  The effects of MOSES controlled O 3  exposures on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were modified by ambient NO 2  and CO, and PES NO 2 . Reductions in FEV 1  and FVC were observed only when these concentrations were in the ""medium"" or ""high"" tertile in the 72 hours before the pre-exposure visit. There was no such modification of the effect of controlled O 3  exposure on any other cardiopulmonary outcome group. Conclusions:  Reductions in markers of lung function, but not other pathways, by the MOSES controlled O 3  exposure were modified by ambient NO 2  and CO, and PES NO 2 , and these reductions were observed only when these pollutant concentrations were elevated in the hours and days before the pre-exposure visit.Clinical trial registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01487005).",2020,"Reductions in FEV 1  and FVC were observed only when these concentrations were in the ""medium"" or ""high"" tertile in the 72 hours before the pre-exposure visit.",['oldEr Subjects'],"['Controlled Ozone Exposure', 'clean air containing 0 ppb O 3 , 70 ppb O 3 , or 120 ppm O 3 , alternating 15 minutes of moderate exercise with 15 minutes of rest']","['personal measures of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and O 3 , or ambient concentrations of O 3 , particulate matter ≤2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter, NO 2 , carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ', 'markers of lung function', 'forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC', 'Cardiovascular and pulmonary endpoints (biomarkers of autonomic function, repolarization, ST segment change, arrhythmia, prothrombotic vascular status, systemic inflammation, vascular function, pulmonary function, oxidative stress, and lung injury', 'FEV 1  and FVC', 'ambient pollutant concentrations']","[{'cui': 'C0580836', 'cui_str': 'Old'}]","[{'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}, {'cui': 'C0030106', 'cui_str': 'Ozone'}, {'cui': 'C0274281', 'cui_str': 'Effect of exposure to external cause'}, {'cui': 'C0402683', 'cui_str': 'Cleaner'}, {'cui': 'C0001861', 'cui_str': 'Air'}, {'cui': 'C0332256', 'cui_str': 'Containing'}, {'cui': 'C0032441', 'cui_str': 'Polybrominated biphenyl'}, {'cui': 'C4319550', 'cui_str': '120'}, {'cui': 'C0439187', 'cui_str': 'ppm'}, {'cui': 'C0332270', 'cui_str': 'Alternating'}, {'cui': 'C1442447', 'cui_str': 'Fifteen minutes'}, {'cui': 'C0205081', 'cui_str': 'Moderate'}, {'cui': 'C0015259', 'cui_str': 'Exercise'}, {'cui': 'C0035253', 'cui_str': 'Rest'}]","[{'cui': 'C0079809', 'cui_str': 'Measure'}, {'cui': 'C0028160', 'cui_str': 'Nitrogen dioxide'}, {'cui': 'C0004268', 'cui_str': 'Attention'}, {'cui': 'C1720884', 'cui_str': 'Particulate Matter'}, {'cui': 'C1301886', 'cui_str': 'Diameter'}, {'cui': 'C0007018', 'cui_str': 'Carbon Monoxide'}, {'cui': 'C0038777', 'cui_str': 'Sulfur Dioxide'}, {'cui': 'C0005516', 'cui_str': 'Biological Markers'}, {'cui': 'C0024119', 'cui_str': 'Pulmonary function test'}, {'cui': 'C0849974', 'cui_str': 'FEV 1'}, {'cui': 'C0430511', 'cui_str': 'Vital capacity test'}, {'cui': 'C3714541', 'cui_str': 'Forced vital capacity'}, {'cui': 'C0007226', 'cui_str': 'Structure of cardiovascular system'}, {'cui': 'C0024109', 'cui_str': 'Lung structure'}, {'cui': 'C0004388', 'cui_str': 'Autonomic nervous system structure'}, {'cui': 'C0031843', 'cui_str': 'PH'}, {'cui': 'C0429029', 'cui_str': 'ST segment'}, {'cui': 'C0037400', 'cui_str': 'Social Change'}, {'cui': 'C0003811', 'cui_str': 'Cardiac arrhythmia'}, {'cui': 'C0005847', 'cui_str': 'Blood vessel structure'}, {'cui': 'C0449438', 'cui_str': 'Status'}, {'cui': 'C0205373', 'cui_str': 'Systemic'}, {'cui': 'C0021368', 'cui_str': 'Inflammation'}, {'cui': 'C0232337', 'cui_str': 'Vascular function'}, {'cui': 'C0231921', 'cui_str': 'Pulmonary function'}, {'cui': 'C0242606', 'cui_str': 'Oxidative stress'}, {'cui': 'C0273115', 'cui_str': 'Injury of lung'}, {'cui': 'C0014417', 'cui_str': 'Pollutants, Environmental'}]",,0.0286714,"Reductions in FEV 1  and FVC were observed only when these concentrations were in the ""medium"" or ""high"" tertile in the 72 hours before the pre-exposure visit.","[{'ForeName': 'David Q', 'Initials': 'DQ', 'LastName': 'Rich', 'Affiliation': 'University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York.'}, {'ForeName': 'Sally W', 'Initials': 'SW', 'LastName': 'Thurston', 'Affiliation': 'University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York.'}, {'ForeName': 'John R', 'Initials': 'JR', 'LastName': 'Balmes', 'Affiliation': 'University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California.'}, {'ForeName': 'Philip A', 'Initials': 'PA', 'LastName': 'Bromberg', 'Affiliation': 'University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina;

Ten patients receiving 3D conformal radiotherapy and 10 patients receiving curative radiotherapy with IMRT, who were admitted for malignancy control for nasopharyngeal cancer, were included in the study. Swallowing functions were determined by flexible fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation. Premature spillage, retention pooling, penetration, aspiration, and reflex cough were evaluated. No statistically significant difference was found between patients receiving 3D conformal radiotherapy and IMRT regarding the scores of premature spillage, retention pooling, penetration, and aspiration with 3, 5, and 10 mL water and 5 mL yoghurt and fish crackers ( P  > .05). Velopharyngeal insufficiency or delayed onset of swallowing reflex was not found in any of the patients ( P  > .05).

650,31116180,Immunogenicity and Safety of a Quadrivalent Meningococcal ACWY-tetanus Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine 6 Years After MenC Priming as Toddlers.,"BACKGROUND


We assessed immunogenicity, antibody persistence and safety of the meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y-tetanus toxoid (TT) conjugate vaccine (MenACWY-TT) in children primed as toddlers with MenC vaccine.
METHODS


This open, multicenter extension study enrolled children 84-95 months of age who had received one dose of the combined Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)-MenC-TT conjugate vaccine (HibMenC group) or Hib-TT and monovalent MenC (MCC)-CRM197 vaccines (Hib+MCC group) at 12-18 months of age, in the primary study. All participants received one dose of MenACWY-TT. We assessed immunogenicity against MenA, MenC, MenW and MenY at 1 month and 2 years postvaccination by serum bactericidal assay using baby rabbit complement (rSBA). Safety and reactogenicity were evaluated.
RESULTS


Six years post-MenC vaccination, <20% of children retained rSBA-MenC titers ≥1:8. At 1 month post-MenACWY-TT vaccination, vaccine response rates against all serogroups were high for both groups with ≥97.1% of children having rSBA ≥1:8. Two years postvaccination, ≥63.6% of children retained rSBA-MenA ≥1:8, and ≥87.9% for other serogroups. Geometric mean titers for all serogroups declined at 2 years post-MenACWY-TT vaccination, but remained ≥13 times higher than prevaccination levels. For both groups, pain (≤58.5%), redness (≤51.4%) and fatigue (≤27.0%) were the most frequently reported adverse events. No serious adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSIONS


One dose of MenACWY-TT boosts protection against MenC in primed children, is safe and extends protection against MenA, MenW and MenY. Immunogenicity and safety were comparable in infants vaccinated with conjugated vaccine (HibMenC-TT) or the separate vaccines (Hib-TT and MCC-CRM197).",2019,"One dose of MenACWY-TT boosts protection against MenC in primed children, is safe and extends protection against MenA, MenW and MenY.

651,32352714,Abdominal Pain Response to Rifaximin in Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome With Diarrhea.,"INTRODUCTION


Abdominal pain is the principal symptom of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This analysis examined abdominal pain response in adults with IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) receiving the nonsystemic antibiotic rifaximin.
METHODS


In the Targeted Nonsystemic Antibiotic Rifaximin Gut-Selective Evaluation of Treatment for IBS-D 3 trial, adults with IBS-D received open-label rifaximin 550 mg 3 times daily for 2 weeks, followed by the 4-week post-treatment phase assessing abdominal pain and stool consistency response. Responders were followed for up to 18 additional weeks; patients with recurrence were randomly assigned to receive two 2-week courses of double-blind rifaximin 550 mg 3 times daily or placebo, separated by 10 weeks. Analyses evaluated mean weekly improvements from baseline (e.g., ≥30%, ≥40%, and ≥50%) in abdominal pain during the 4-week post-repeat-treatment phases.
RESULTS


Of the 2,438 evaluable patients, 1,384 (56.8%) had abdominal pain response to open-label rifaximin (≥30% improvement from baseline in the mean weekly abdominal pain score during ≥2 of the first 4 weeks post-treatment). Weekly decrease (improvement) in responders' mean abdominal pain score (scale range, 0-10) from baseline ranged from -2.6 to -3.3 points during the 18-week follow-up. After the first double-blind repeat treatment, a significantly higher percentage of rifaximin-treated patients were abdominal pain responders (53.9% [172/319]) vs placebo (44.4% [134/302], P = 0.02), with similar results after the second repeat treatment (52.9% [155/293] vs 44.7% [123/275], respectively, P = 0.047). A significantly higher percentage of rifaximin-treated patients were weekly abdominal pain responders for ≥50% of the 18-week double-blind repeat treatment phase (47.9% [138/288] vs 35.9% [97/270], P = 0.004).

653,30663195,Prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the elderly using the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly study cohort.,"AIM


The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the elderly is controversial because age-related decline in kidney function may not truly reflect underlying kidney disease. We estimate the baseline prevalence and predictors of CKD using the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI eGFR  ) and Berlin Initiative Study 1 (BIS1 eGFR  ) eGFR equations in the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial cohort of healthy older participants.
METHODS


GFR was estimated using CKD-EPI and BIS1 equations. CKD was defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2  or ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2  with urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 3 mg/mmol. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of CKD prevalence defined by each eGFR equation.
RESULTS


Data for analysis were complete for 17,762 participants. Mean age was 75.1 years (SD 5); 56.4% were female, 76.4% had hypertension, 9% had diabetes mellitus. Mean CKD-EPI eGFR  was 73.0 (SD 14.2), compared with mean BIS1 eGFR  of 62.7 (11.4). Median UACR was 0.8 (IQR 0.5, 1.5) mg/mmol. Prevalence of CKD by CKD-EPI eGFR  was 27% (predominantly due to normoalbuminuric stage 3a CKD), substantially lower than 47.1% by BIS1 eGFR  ; the difference was predominantly driven by reclassification of individuals from G1 and G2 CKD to stage G3a without albuminuria. Increased prevalence of CKD by either equation was related to older age, hypertension, diabetes, or higher body mass index.
CONCLUSIONS


Prevalence of CKD with CKD-EPI eGFR  was 27%, and doubled using the elderly specific BIS1 eGFR  , with most participants reclassified from stage 2 to stage 3a. Increased prevalence of CKD was related older age, hypertension, diabetes, or increased body mass index.",2019,"Increased prevalence of CKD was related older age, hypertension, diabetes, or increased body mass index.","['17,762 participants', 'Mean age was 75.1 years (SD 5); 56.4% were female, 76.4% had hypertension, 9% had diabetes mellitus', 'healthy older participants']",['ASPirin'],"['Prevalence of CKD by CKD-EPI eGFR', 'Median UACR', 'Mean CKD-EPI eGFR']","[{'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0043210', 'cui_str': 'Woman'}, {'cui': 'C0020538', 'cui_str': 'Hypertensive disorder'}, {'cui': 'C0011849', 'cui_str': 'Diabetes mellitus'}, {'cui': 'C0580836', 'cui_str': 'Old'}]","[{'cui': 'C0004057', 'cui_str': 'Aspirin'}]","[{'cui': 'C0033105', 'cui_str': 'Prevalence'}, {'cui': 'C1561643', 'cui_str': 'Chronic kidney disease'}, {'cui': 'C0014563', 'cui_str': 'Epinephrine'}, {'cui': 'C0034802', 'cui_str': 'Epidermal growth factor-urogastrone receptor'}, {'cui': 'C0549183', 'cui_str': 'Midline'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}]",17762.0,0.0201638,"Increased prevalence of CKD was related older age, hypertension, diabetes, or increased body mass index.","[{'ForeName': 'Kevan R', 'Initials': 'KR', 'LastName': 'Polkinghorne', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Rory', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Wolfe', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kim M', 'Initials': 'KM', 'LastName': 'Jachno', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'ForeName': 'James B', 'Initials': 'JB', 'LastName': 'Wetmore', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Hennepin Healthcare Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Robyn L', 'Initials': 'RL', 'LastName': 'Woods', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'ForeName': 'John J', 'Initials': 'JJ', 'LastName': 'McNeil', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Mark R', 'Initials': 'MR', 'LastName': 'Nelson', 'Affiliation': 'Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Christopher M', 'Initials': 'CM', 'LastName': 'Reid', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Anne M', 'Initials': 'AM', 'LastName': 'Murray', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Hennepin Healthcare Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.'}, {'ForeName': '', 'Initials': '', 'LastName': '', 'Affiliation': ''}]","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",['10.1111/nep.13565']
654,30707002,Metabolic Syndrome Interferes with Packaging of Proteins within Porcine Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles.,"Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) release extracellular vesicles (EVs), which shuttle proteins to recipient cells, promoting cellular repair. We hypothesized that cardiovascular risk factors may alter the pattern of proteins packed within MSC-derived EVs. To test this, we compared the protein cargo of EVs to their parent MSCs in pigs with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and Lean controls. Porcine MSCs were harvested from abdominal fat after 16 weeks of Lean- or MetS-diet (n = 5 each), and their EVs isolated. Following liquid chromatography mass spectrometry proteomic analysis, proteins were classified based on cellular component, molecular function, and protein class. Five candidate proteins were validated by Western blot. Clustering analysis was performed to identify primary functional categories of proteins enriched in or excluded from EVs. Proteomics analysis identified 6,690 and 6,790 distinct proteins in Lean- and MetS-EVs, respectively. Differential expression analysis revealed that 146 proteins were upregulated and 273 downregulated in Lean-EVs versus Lean-MSCs, whereas 787 proteins were upregulated and 185 downregulated in MetS-EVs versus MetS-MSCs. Proteins enriched in both Lean- and MetS-EVs participate in vesicle-mediated transport and cell-to-cell communication. Proteins enriched exclusively in Lean-EVs modulate pathways related to the MSC reparative capacity, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and activation, as well as transforming growth factor-β signaling. Contrarily, proteins enriched only in MetS-EVs are linked to proinflammatory pathways, including acute inflammatory response, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and cytokine production. Coculture with MetS-EVs increased renal tubular cell inflammation. MetS alters the protein cargo of porcine MSC-derived EVs, selectively packaging specific proinflammatory signatures that may impair their ability to repair damaged tissues.

655,31706911,Efficacy of cross-match compatible platelets in multi transfused haemato-oncology patients refractory to platelet transfusion.,"BACKGROUND


Platelet refractoriness, which leads to platelet transfusion failure resulting in significant morbidity and long hospital stay, is routinely not investigated.
AIMS


To determine the efficacy of cross-match compatible platelets in multi-transfused alloimmunized hemato-oncological patients refractory to platelet transfusion.
MATERIALS AND METHOD


149 ABO compatible single donor apheresis platelet transfusions given to 38 alloimmunized refractory patients. Corrected Count Increment (CCI) <5000 (1 h) was taken to define refractoriness. Solid-phase red cell adherence assay was used to determine the alloimmunization status and platelet cross-matching. Post Transfusion Platelet Increment, CCI and the Percentage Platelet Recovery were used to monitor the effectiveness of platelet transfusion. ANOVA test followed by Post hoc test Tukey HSD used to compare group means and classified into three groups depending upon the cross-matching and compatibility status. Categorical data was analysed for various outcomes using Pearson's chi square test or Fischer exact test.
RESULT


Patients showed statistically significant recovery in terms of PPI, CCI and PPR at 1 h post SDAP transfusions when they received cross-matched compatible platelets. The one-hour CCI was significantly higher for cross-match-compatible platelets (19173 ± 2692) than for incompatible (5888 ± 1526) and for uncross-matched (8140 ± 1480). Forty four (97.8%) of 45 cross-matched compatible platelet transfusion episodes showed a satisfactory response in terms of PPI and CCI values as compared to 50 % and 53.9% in uncross-matched group respectively (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION

656,31821210,Global Burden of Craniofacial Disorders: Where Should Volunteering Plastic Surgeons and Governments Focus Their Care?,"PURPOSE


Approximately 11% of the global burden of disease is surgically treatable. When located within the head, face, and neck region, plastic surgeons are particularly trained to treat these conditions. The purpose of this study was to describe the etiology, disability, and barriers to receiving care for diseases of the head, face, mouth, and neck region across 4 low-and-middle-income countries.
METHODS


The Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS) instrument is a cluster randomized, cross-sectional, national survey administered in Nepal, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Uganda from 2011 to 2014. The survey identifies demographic characteristics, etiology, disease timing, proportion seeking/receiving care, barriers to care, and disability.
RESULTS


Across the 4 countries, 1413 diseases of head, face, mouth, and neck region were identified. Masses (22.13%) and trauma (32.8%) were the most common etiology. Nepal reported the largest proportion of masses (40.22%) and Rwanda reported the largest amount of trauma (52.65%) (P < 0.001). Rwanda had the highest proportion of individuals seeking (89.6%) and receiving care (83.63%) while Sierra Leone reported the fewest (60% versus 47.77%, P < 0.001). In our multi-variate analysis literacy and chronic conditions were predictors for receiving care while diseases causing the greatest disability predicted not receiving care (ORa .58 and .48 versus 1.31 P < 0.001).

657,32358235,The Role of Postoperative Bandage Contact Lens in Patients Undergoing Fasanella-Servat Ptosis Repair.,"PURPOSE


To determine whether a bandage contact lens (BCL) improves patient comfort in the postoperative period in patients undergoing ptosis repair using the Fasanella-Servat technique, compared with no BCL.
METHODS


In this prospective, randomized, double-masked, comparison study, all patients had bilateral Fasanella-Servat surgery. A total of 30 patients were randomized to receive a BCL in one eye and no BCL in the other eye. Patient discomfort was measured as the primary outcome using the Eye Sensation Scale. Blurred vision was measured as a secondary outcome using selected questions from the Ocular Surface Disease Index. The surgeries were performed by 2 surgeons (J.T.H and R.S.A). Outcomes were measured one week following the procedure.
RESULTS


Patients reported significantly less discomfort in the eye receiving a BCL, with only 13.3% ranking discomfort as ""moderate"" or ""severe,"" compared with the eye not receiving BCL, where 63.3% of patients rated discomfort as ""moderate"" or ""severe"" (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in patient-reported blurred vision between the 2 groups (p = 0.520).
CONCLUSIONS


The use of a bandage contact lens after Fasanella-Servat procedure for ptosis repair is recommended as it improves patient comfort. In addition, it has no detrimental effect on patient-reported blurring of vision.",2020,"There was no significant difference in patient-reported blurred vision between the 2 groups (p = 0.520).

658,32358259,Evaluation of total corneal power measurements with a new optical biometer.,"PURPOSE


To evaluate the repeatability and validity of total corneal power measurements (total keratometry [TK]) obtained with a recently introduced optical biometer (IOLMaster 700, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG) to a Scheimpflug device (Pentacam, Oculus).
SETTING


Department of Ophthalmology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.
DESIGN


Prospective randomized controlled trial.
METHODS


The inclusion criteria were a corneal astigmatism of 3.00 diopters (D) or less, no previous ocular surgery, no known corneal irregularities, and no known dry eyes. All eyes were measured 3 times using the optical biometer and the Scheimpflug device. The results were statistically compared using Bland-Altman, within-subject SD, and astigmatism vector analysis.
RESULTS


Ninety-three eyes of 93 subjects were included. Overall, the repeatability of all eyes measured was 0.42 for standard K, 0.40 for TK, 0.45 for total corneal refractive power (TCRP), 0.43 for true net power (TNP), and 0.39 for simulated K. Bland-Altman analysis showed no significant difference between the optical biometer's TK compared with standard K and the Scheimpflug device's simulated K, TNP, and TCRP, the P value exceeding .05 in each case. A difference of >0.50 diopters between astigmatism measurements between TK and TCRP was found in 10 cases compared with standard K and TNP with 0 and 2 cases.
CONCLUSIONS


Repeatability of both devices was high, although measurements of meridian showed a great variability, suggesting that numerous measurements are needed to enhance accuracy. TCRP measurements between recently introduced TK and TCRP cannot be used interchangeably.

659,32358262,Comparison of visual and refractive outcomes of 2 trifocal intraocular lenses.,"PURPOSE


To compare clinical outcomes after cataract surgery and bilateral implantation of 2 diffractive trifocal toric intraocular lenses (IOLs).
SETTING


Hospital da Luz, Lisbon, Portugal.
DESIGN


Double-arm, randomized, prospective case series.
METHODS


A total of 60 patients were randomly allocated to receive bilateral implantation of either the FineVision Pod FT toric IOL (PhysIOL) or the AcrySof IQ PanOptix toric IOL (Alcon). Visual and refractive outcomes, contrast sensitivity, IOL misalignment, and quality of vision outcomes (QoV questionnaire) were evaluated at 3 months postoperatively. Surgically induced astigmatic changes were evaluated by vector analysis.
RESULTS


Each group (FineVision toric and AcrySof IQ PanOptix toric) comprised 30 patients (60 eyes). No significant differences between groups were found regarding uncorrected and corrected distance and near visual outcomes (P ≥ .333). Mean postoperative distance-corrected intermediate visual acuity at 60 cm was 0.04 ± 0.09 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) and 0.09 ± 0.11 logMAR in the PanOptix and Pod FT group, respectively (P = .032). Mean IOL axis misalignment was 1.59 degrees ± 2.15 degrees (PanOptix group) and 1.89 degrees ± 3.31 degrees (Pod FT group) (P = .821). Mean magnitude of error of astigmatic correction was -0.09 diopters (D) and -0.11 D in the PanOptix group and Pod FT group, respectively (P = .333). Contrast sensitivity, QoV scores for the presence of photic phenomena, and the level of spectacle independence were similar in both groups (P > .05).
CONCLUSIONS


Both trifocal toric IOLs allowed complete patient visual restoration, and good spectacle independence and good visual quality outcomes.

660,32358267,Influence of angle κ on visual and refractive outcomes after implantation of a diffractive trifocal intraocular lens.,"PURPOSE


To evaluate changes in angle κ after the implantation of a trifocal intraocular lens (IOL) and to assess the postoperative outcomes of patients with different angle κ values.
SETTING


IOA Madrid Innova Ocular, Madrid, Spain.
DESIGN


Prospective trial.
METHODS


Sixty-three eyes from 63 patients who had bilateral implantation of a diffractive trifocal IOL (POD F, PhysIOL) were included. Pupil offset was used as the best estimate of angle κ and was measured using Pentacam (Oculus) preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively. Postoperative refractive outcomes (sphere, cylinder, and manifest refraction spherical equivalent) and visual outcomes at far, intermediate, and near distance were assessed and compared between eyes with small pupil offset and eyes with large pupil offset. Quality of vision was assessed using a subjective questionnaire.
RESULTS


There was a significant decrease in pupil offset values postoperatively (mean: 0.197 ± 0.12 mm) compared with those preoperatively (mean: 0.239 ± 0.12 mm), with a mean decrease of -0.042 mm (P = .0002). The same significant decrease was found for both right and left eyes, when analyzed separately. No statistically significant difference was found in any of the refractive and visual acuity outcomes between eyes with small pupil offset and eyes with large pupil offset. The majority of patients (14 of 16) complaining of significant halos had eyes with small pupil offset.
CONCLUSIONS


Large pupil offset did not negatively affect visual and refractive outcomes. The tolerance to larger pupil offset might be due to the IOL optical design, with the first diffractive ring being larger than other commonly used multifocal IOLs. More studies comparing various diffractive IOL models would be useful to confirm such hypothesis.",2020,No statistically significant difference was found in any of the refractive and visual acuity outcomes between eyes with small pupil offset and eyes with large pupil offset.,"['IOA Madrid Innova Ocular, Madrid, Spain', 'Sixty-three eyes from 63 patients who had bilateral implantation of a diffractive trifocal IOL (POD F, PhysIOL) were included', 'patients with different angle κ values']",['trifocal intraocular lens (IOL'],"['Postoperative refractive outcomes (sphere, cylinder, and manifest refraction spherical equivalent) and visual outcomes at far, intermediate, and near distance', 'visual and refractive outcomes', 'pupil offset values', 'Quality of vision', 'refractive and visual acuity outcomes']","[{'cui': 'C0648637', 'cui_str': 'isooctyl acrylate'}, {'cui': 'C0015392', 'cui_str': 'Eye structure'}, {'cui': 'C0037747', 'cui_str': 'Spain'}, {'cui': 'C4319614', 'cui_str': '63'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0238767', 'cui_str': 'Right and left'}, {'cui': 'C0021107', 'cui_str': 'Implantation procedure'}, {'cui': 'C1275646', 'cui_str': 'Trifocal glasses'}, {'cui': 'C0023311', 'cui_str': 'Insertion of intraocular lens'}, {'cui': 'C0332257', 'cui_str': 'Including'}, {'cui': 'C0205143', 'cui_str': 'Angular'}, {'cui': 'C1273875', 'cui_str': 'Values (community)'}]","[{'cui': 'C1275646', 'cui_str': 'Trifocal glasses'}, {'cui': 'C0023311', 'cui_str': 'Insertion of intraocular lens'}]","[{'cui': 'C0032790', 'cui_str': 'Postoperative period'}, {'cui': 'C1274040', 'cui_str': 'Result'}, {'cui': 'C0332501', 'cui_str': 'Spherical shape'}, {'cui': 'C0181797', 'cui_str': 'Medical gas cylinder'}, {'cui': 'C1301318', 'cui_str': 'Subjective refraction'}, {'cui': 'C0205163', 'cui_str': 'Equal'}, {'cui': 'C0234621', 'cui_str': 'Visual'}, {'cui': 'C0205108', 'cui_str': 'Distal'}, {'cui': 'C0205103', 'cui_str': 'Intermediate'}, {'cui': 'C0475806', 'cui_str': '1/3 meter'}, {'cui': 'C0012751', 'cui_str': 'Distance'}, {'cui': 'C0034121', 'cui_str': 'Pupil structure'}, {'cui': 'C1273875', 'cui_str': 'Values (community)'}, {'cui': 'C0332306', 'cui_str': 'Quality'}, {'cui': 'C0042789', 'cui_str': 'Visual function'}, {'cui': 'C0042812', 'cui_str': 'Visual acuity'}]",63.0,0.0391853,No statistically significant difference was found in any of the refractive and visual acuity outcomes between eyes with small pupil offset and eyes with large pupil offset.,"[{'ForeName': 'Nuria', 'Initials': 'N', 'LastName': 'Garzón', 'Affiliation': 'From the IOA Madrid Innova Ocular (Garzón, López-Artero, Poyales); Department of Optica II, Complutense University, Madrid (Garzón, García-Montero); Clínica Oftalmológica Dr Gonzalo Muñoz, Valencia (Albarrán-Diego); Department of Ophthalmology (Oftalmar), Vithas Medimar International Hospital, Alicante (Pérez-Cambrodí); and Begitek, Innova Ocular (Illarramendi), Spain.'}, {'ForeName': 'María', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'García-Montero', 'Affiliation': ''}, {'ForeName': 'Esther', 'Initials': 'E', 'LastName': 'López-Artero', 'Affiliation': ''}, {'ForeName': 'César', 'Initials': 'C', 'LastName': 'Albarrán-Diego', 'Affiliation': ''}, {'ForeName': 'Rafael', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Pérez-Cambrodí', 'Affiliation': ''}, {'ForeName': 'Igor', 'Initials': 'I', 'LastName': 'Illarramendi', 'Affiliation': ''}, {'ForeName': 'Francisco', 'Initials': 'F', 'LastName': 'Poyales', 'Affiliation': ''}]",Journal of cataract and refractive surgery,['10.1097/j.jcrs.0000000000000156']

662,32368702,Robotic versus open primary ventral hernia repair: A randomized controlled trial (Robovent Trial).,"Background


The objective of the present study is to compare the outcomes open PVHR and robotic PVHR.
Methods/Design


The present study will be a randomized single-blinded controlled trial with intention-to-treat analysis comparing robotic PVHR to open PVHR in adult patients undergoing elective PVHR with a defect ranging between 1-5 cm. Patient refusing to participate, not able to give informed consent, with history of intra-abdominal surgery contraindicating a robotic surgical approach will be excluded. The intervention will consist in laparoscopic robotically assisted trans-abdominal pre-peritoneal epigastric or umbilical PVHR with closure of fascial defect and non-adsorbable mesh reinforcement. The control will be open pre-peritoneal epigastric or umbilical hernia repair with closure of fascial defect and non-absorbable mesh reinforcement. The primary outcome will be the incidence of wound-related complication within 1 month. The secondary outcomes will be esthetic satisfaction, pain, pain-killers consumption, general complications, costs, operative time and early hernia recurrence.
Discussion


Open PVHR is potentially associated to more wound-related complications, but has the advantages of cost-effectiveness, short operative time and totally extra-peritoneal repair. Laparoscopic PVHR has lower wound-related complications but implies placing the mesh in intra-peritoneal position, requires advanced laparoscopic skills, usually does not allow the closure of the defect, and can lead to excessive pain and pain-killers consumption. Robotic PVHR uses the same laparoscopic access as laparoscopic PVHR, but thanks to the extended range of motion given by the robotic system, allows defect closure, pre-peritoneal placement of the mesh and requires less technical skills.In the present randomized controlled trial, we expect to show that robotic PVHR leads to better wound-related outcomes than open PVHR.

663,32368713,"¡Sí, Yo Puedo Vivir Sano con Diabetes!  A Self-Management Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial for Low-Income Adults with Type 2 Diabetes in Mexico City.","Background


Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a worldwide epidemic and a leading cause of death in Mexico, with a prevalence of 15.9%, and >70% of diagnosed adults have poor glycemic control [glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >7.5%]. We developed a diabetes self-management education program contextualized to the study population, including dietary preferences, health literacy, and health system.
Objectives


We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a self-management + text message program ( ¡Sí, Yo Puedo Vivir Sano con Diabetes! ) on primary (HbA1c), and secondary behavioral (self-management), clinical, and psychosocial outcomes in adults with T2D in Mexico City.
Methods


Participants were recruited at public primary healthcare centers ( Seguro Popular ), and randomly allocated to treatment ( n  = 26) or wait-list control groups ( n  = 21) with data collected at 3 and 6 mo. The program included 7 weekly sessions and 6 mo of daily text/picture messages. Descriptive statistics and a generalized linear mixed model with intent-to-treat analysis were calculated.
Results


Participants were 55.5 ± 8.8 y of age (mean ± SD), 68% female, 88.6% overweight/obese, and 57% lived in food-insecure households. Mean ± SD T2D duration was 11.9 ± 7.8 y and HbA1c was 9.2% ± 1.5%. There was 89% attendance at sessions and 6.4% attrition across both groups at 6 mo. Group-by-time effects were seen in self-monitoring of blood glucose ( P  < 0.01) and diabetes self-efficacy ( P  < 0.04); and a trend for lower HbA1c was seen in the intervention group at 6 mo ( P  = 0.11). Significant improvements in dietary behavior ( P  < 0.01) were demonstrated in the intervention group over time, but this did not reach statistical significance compared with the control group.
Conclusions


The program was associated with clinically significant improvements in T2D self-management, self-efficacy, and HbA1c over time. Thus, T2D self-management skills, including diet, were improved in a vulnerable metropolitan population.This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03159299.",2020,"The program was associated with clinically significant improvements in T2D self-management, self-efficacy, and HbA1c over time.","['adults with T2D in Mexico City', 'Methods\n\n\nParticipants were recruited at public primary healthcare centers ( Seguro Popular ', 'Results\n\n\nParticipants were 55.5\xa0±\xa08.8 y of age (mean\xa0±\xa0SD), 68% female, 88.6% overweight/obese, and 57% lived in food-insecure households', 'Low-Income Adults with Type 2 Diabetes in Mexico City']",['self-management\xa0+\xa0text message program ( ¡'],"['self-monitoring of blood glucose', 'dietary behavior', 'T2D self-management, self-efficacy, and HbA1c over time', 'diabetes self-efficacy', 'Mean\xa0±\xa0SD', 'primary (HbA1c), and secondary behavioral (self-management), clinical, and psychosocial outcomes']","[{'cui': 'C0001675', 'cui_str': 'Adult'}, {'cui': 'C0332307', 'cui_str': 'Type - attribute'}, {'cui': 'C0025885', 'cui_str': 'Mexico'}, {'cui': 'C0008848', 'cui_str': 'Cities'}, {'cui': 'C0025663', 'cui_str': 'Method'}, {'cui': 'C0033137', 'cui_str': 'Primary Care'}, {'cui': 'C0205099', 'cui_str': 'Central'}, {'cui': 'C0678226', 'cui_str': 'Due to'}, {'cui': 'C4517882', 'cui_str': '8.8'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0043210', 'cui_str': 'Woman'}, {'cui': 'C0497406', 'cui_str': 'Overweight'}, {'cui': 'C0028754', 'cui_str': 'Obesity'}, {'cui': 'C1634625', 'cui_str': '% live'}, {'cui': 'C0016452', 'cui_str': 'Foods'}, {'cui': 'C0020052', 'cui_str': 'Households'}, {'cui': 'C0032854', 'cui_str': 'Financially poor'}]","[{'cui': 'C0086969', 'cui_str': 'Self Management'}, {'cui': 'C3178910', 'cui_str': 'Text Messages'}, {'cui': 'C0018106', 'cui_str': 'Government Programs'}]","[{'cui': 'C0005803', 'cui_str': 'Self-monitoring of blood glucose'}, {'cui': 'C0012155', 'cui_str': 'Dietary finding'}, {'cui': 'C0004927', 'cui_str': 'Behavior finding'}, {'cui': 'C0011860', 'cui_str': 'Type 2 diabetes mellitus'}, {'cui': 'C0086969', 'cui_str': 'Self Management'}, {'cui': 'C0600564', 'cui_str': 'Self Efficacy'}, {'cui': 'C0019018', 'cui_str': 'Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated'}, {'cui': 'C0040223', 'cui_str': 'Time'}, {'cui': 'C0011849', 'cui_str': 'Diabetes mellitus'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0205225', 'cui_str': 'Principal'}, {'cui': 'C0027627', 'cui_str': 'Metastasis'}, {'cui': 'C0205210', 'cui_str': 'Clinical'}, {'cui': 'C1274040', 'cui_str': 'Result'}]",,0.0632674,"The program was associated with clinically significant improvements in T2D self-management, self-efficacy, and HbA1c over time.","[{'ForeName': 'Robin', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Whittemore', 'Affiliation': 'Yale School of Nursing, West Haven, CT, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Mireya', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Vilar-Compte', 'Affiliation': 'Research Institute for Equitable Development (EQUIDE), Universidad Iberoamericana , Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'ForeName': 'Selene', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'De La Cerda', 'Affiliation': 'Research Institute for Equitable Development (EQUIDE), Universidad Iberoamericana , Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'ForeName': 'Roberta', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Delvy', 'Affiliation': 'Yale School of Nursing, West Haven, CT, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Sangchoon', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Jeon', 'Affiliation': 'Yale School of Nursing, West Haven, CT, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Soraya', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Burrola-Méndez', 'Affiliation': 'Research Institute for Equitable Development (EQUIDE), Universidad Iberoamericana , Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'ForeName': 'Mariana', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Pardo-Carrillo', 'Affiliation': 'Research Institute for Equitable Development (EQUIDE), Universidad Iberoamericana , Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'ForeName': 'Annel', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Lozano-Marrufo', 'Affiliation': 'Research Institute for Equitable Development (EQUIDE), Universidad Iberoamericana , Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'ForeName': 'Rafael', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Pérez-Escamilla', 'Affiliation': 'Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT, USA.'}]",Current developments in nutrition,['10.1093/cdn/nzaa074']

665,32368936,RehaCom rehabilitation training improves a wide-range of cognitive functions in multiple sclerosis patients.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that impairs cognitive performance. Attention, response control, working memory, and processing speed are highly impaired in MS. On the other hand, RehaCom is a computerized software that improves cognitive dysfunctions. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of RehaCom on attention, response control, processing speed, working memory, visuospatial skills, and verbal/non-verbal executive functions in MS patients. Sixty patients were selected randomly and divided into control ( n  = 30) and experimental ( n  = 30) groups. Integrated Auditory Visual-2 (IVA-2), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Judgment of Line Orientation (JLO) and The Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) were used to assess cognitive functions. Patients in the experimental group were treated by RehaCom for 5 weeks (two 60-min sessions per week).

666,32368942,Isokinetic Strength Comparison of Tuberosity Fractures of the Proximal Fifth Metatarsal Treated With Elastic Bandage vs Cast.,"BACKGROUND


The aim of this study was to compare the strength of injured and healthy ankle muscle as well as functional and clinical outcomes between patients with proximal fifth metatarsal tuberosity fractures who received elastic bandage treatment and those who received cast immobilization.
METHODS


Sixty-five patients who presented to our clinic between February 2018 and April 2019 were randomly divided into 2 groups: 33 received elastic bandages (group 1) and 32 received cast immobilization (group 2). All patients were scheduled for follow-up appointments at our clinic after 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. Visual analog scale-foot and ankle (VAS-FA) score, time missed from work, and using assistive devices were recorded as clinical outcomes. Both ankle plantarflexion-dorsiflexion and inversion-eversion muscle strengths (peak torque) were measured using an isokinetic dynamometer for each group and were compared with those of the healthy extremities.
RESULTS


The mean missed work was 11.3 days in group 1 and 27.6 days in group 2. Groups 1 and 2 used assistive devices for a mean of 6.7 and 16.2 days, respectively ( P  = .001). Group 1 had a significantly higher VAS-FA score at the 2nd, 4th, and 8th week of follow-up compared with group 2, and no significant differences were observed at the time of injury and at the 12th and 24th weeks. The muscle strength deficits in group 1 were present at the 4th week, whereas those in the cast immobilization group were determined at the 4th and 8th weeks in all muscles. During the 12th and 24th week of follow-up, no significantly differences in both extremities were observed between the groups.
CONCLUSION


Elastic bandage treatment was better than cast immobilization in terms of preserving ankle muscle strength, clinical outcomes, and functional scores regardless of the degree of fracture displacement. Moreover, the present study emphasized that cast immobilization offered no advantages in this fracture treatment.

667,32369007,Computerised speech and language therapy or attention control added to usual care for people with long-term post-stroke aphasia: the Big CACTUS three-arm RCT.,"BACKGROUND


People with aphasia may improve their communication with speech and language therapy many months/years after stroke. However, NHS speech and language therapy reduces in availability over time post stroke.
OBJECTIVE


This trial evaluated the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of self-managed computerised speech and language therapy to provide additional therapy.
DESIGN


A pragmatic, superiority, single-blind, parallel-group, individually randomised (stratified block randomisation, stratified by word-finding severity and site) adjunct trial.
SETTING


Twenty-one UK NHS speech and language therapy departments.
PARTICIPANTS


People with post-stroke aphasia (diagnosed by a speech and language therapist) with long-standing (> 4 months) word-finding difficulties.
INTERVENTIONS


The groups were (1) usual care; (2) daily self-managed computerised word-finding therapy tailored by speech and language therapists and supported by volunteers/speech and language therapy assistants for 6 months plus usual care (computerised speech and language therapy); and (3) activity/attention control (completion of puzzles and receipt of telephone calls from a researcher for 6 months) plus usual care.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES


Co-primary outcomes - change in ability to find treated words of personal relevance in a bespoke naming test (impairment) and change in functional communication in conversation rated on the activity scale of the Therapy Outcome Measures (activity) 6 months after randomisation. A key secondary outcome was participant-rated perception of communication and quality of life using the Communication Outcomes After Stroke questionnaire at 6 months. Outcomes were assessed by speech and language therapists using standardised procedures. Cost-effectiveness was estimated using treatment costs and an accessible EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version, measuring quality-adjusted life-years.
RESULTS


A total of 818 patients were assessed for eligibility and 278 participants were randomised between October 2014 and August 2016. A total of 240 participants (86 usual care, 83 computerised speech and language therapy, 71 attention control) contributed to modified intention-to-treat analysis at 6 months. The mean improvements in word-finding were 1.1% (standard deviation 11.2%) for usual care, 16.4% (standard deviation 15.3%) for computerised speech and language therapy and 2.4% (standard deviation 8.8%) for attention control. Computerised speech and language therapy improved word-finding 16.2% more than usual care did (95% confidence interval 12.7% to 19.6%;  p  < 0.0001) and 14.4% more than attention control did (95% confidence interval 10.8% to 18.1%). Most of this effect was maintained at 12 months ( n  = 219); the mean differences in change in word-finding score were 12.7% (95% confidence interval 8.7% to 16.7%) higher in the computerised speech and language therapy group ( n  = 74) than in the usual-care group ( n  = 84) and 9.3% (95% confidence interval 4.8% to 13.7%) higher in the computerised speech and language therapy group than in the attention control group ( n  = 61). Computerised speech and language therapy did not show significant improvements on the Therapy Outcome Measures or Communication Outcomes After Stroke scale compared with usual care or attention control. Primary cost-effectiveness analysis estimated an incremental cost per participant of £732.73 (95% credible interval £674.23 to £798.05). The incremental quality-adjusted life-year gain was 0.017 for computerised speech and language therapy compared with usual care, but its direction was uncertain (95% credible interval -0.05 to 0.10), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £42,686 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. For mild and moderate word-finding difficulty subgroups, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were £22,371 and £28,898 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, respectively, for computerised speech and language therapy compared with usual care.
LIMITATIONS


This trial excluded non-English-language speakers, the accessible EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version, was not validated and the measurement of attention control fidelity was limited.
CONCLUSIONS


Computerised speech and language therapy enabled additional self-managed speech and language therapy, contributing to significant improvement in finding personally relevant words (as specifically targeted by computerised speech and language therapy) long term post stroke. Gains did not lead to improvements in conversation or quality of life. Cost-effectiveness is uncertain owing to uncertainty around the quality-adjusted life-year gain, but computerised speech and language therapy may be more cost-effective for participants with mild and moderate word-finding difficulties. Exploring ways of helping people with aphasia to use new words in functional communication contexts is a priority.

668,32369036,Cost-Effectiveness of Virtual Reality Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Psychosis: Health-Economic Evaluation Within a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND


Evidence was found for the effectiveness of virtual reality-based cognitive behavioral therapy (VR-CBT) for treating paranoia in psychosis, but health-economic evaluations are lacking.
OBJECTIVE


This study aimed to determine the short-term cost-effectiveness of VR-CBT.
METHODS


The health-economic evaluation was embedded in a randomized controlled trial evaluating VR-CBT in 116 patients with a psychotic disorder suffering from paranoid ideation. The control group (n=58) received treatment as usual (TAU) for psychotic disorders in accordance with the clinical guidelines. The experimental group (n=58) received TAU complemented with add-on VR-CBT to reduce paranoid ideation and social avoidance. Data were collected at baseline and at 3 and 6 months postbaseline. Treatment response was defined as a pre-post improvement of symptoms of at least 20% in social participation measures. Change in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was estimated by using Sanderson et al's conversion factor to map a change in the standardized mean difference of Green's Paranoid Thoughts Scale score on a corresponding change in utility. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated using 5000 bootstraps of seemingly unrelated regression equations of costs and effects. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were graphed for the costs per treatment responder gained and per QALY gained.
RESULTS


The average mean incremental costs for a treatment responder on social participation ranged between €8079 and €19,525, with 90.74%-99.74% showing improvement. The average incremental cost per QALY was €48,868 over the 6 months of follow-up, with 99.98% showing improved QALYs. Sensitivity analyses show costs to be lower when relevant baseline differences were included in the analysis. Average costs per treatment responder now ranged between €6800 and €16,597, while the average cost per QALY gained was €42,030.
CONCLUSIONS


This study demonstrates that offering VR-CBT to patients with paranoid delusions is an economically viable approach toward improving patients' health in a cost-effective manner. Long-term effects need further research.

One hundred and eighty-nine patients with H-AML in CR1 were enrolled in this multicentre prospective cohort study. Patients were assigned to groups transplanted with HID (n = 83) or MSD (n = 106) based on donor availability (biological randomization). The primary endpoint was the incidence of MRD positivity posttransplantation (post-MRD+). All post-MRD+ patients received preemptive interventions. The cumulative incidences of post-MRD+ were 18 and 42% in HID and MSD groups, respectively, (p < 0.001). Fifty-two patients received preemptive DLI, including 13 (16%) in HID and 39 cases (37%) in MSD groups (p = 0.001). Among HID and MSD groups, the 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse were 14 and 24% (p = 0.101); the 3-year cumulative incidence of treatment-related mortality were 15 and 10% (p = 0.368); the 3-year overall survival rates were 72 and 68% (p = 0.687); the 3-year disease-free-survival were 71 and 66% (p = 0.579); the 3-year graft-versus-host disease and relapse free survival were 63 and 43% (p = 0.035), respectively.

671,32367175,Impact of a 12-Week Randomized Exercise Training Program on Lipid Profile in Severely Obese Patients Following Bariatric Surgery.,"PURPOSE


The benefit of exercise training on lipid profile in bariatric surgery patients is scarce. We assess the effect of a supervised exercise-training program on lipid profile following bariatric surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS


A total of 60 patients were prospectively recruited, of those 49 completed the study (age 41 ± 11 years; body mass index 45.9 ± 6.1 kg/m 2 , 75% women). The bariatric surgery procedures performed were sleeve gastrectomy (SG) (n = 24) and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) (n = 25). Of the 49 patients who completed the study, 34 had been randomized to a 12-week supervised exercise training program (exercise group) between the 3rd and the 6th month following bariatric surgery (SG = 17 and BPD-DS = 17). Fasting blood samples and anthropometric measurements were performed preoperatively and at 3, 6, and 12 months after bariatric surgery.
RESULTS


At 6 months and 12 months, percentage of weight loss was similar between groups (6 months: - 29.6 ± 5.5 vs. - 27.8 ± 7.7%; P = 0.371; 12 months: - 38.4 ± 10.4 vs. - 37.9 ± 9.5%; P = 0.876 exercise vs. control). Both groups had an increase in HDL values between the 3nd and the 6th month following bariatric surgery. There was a significantly greater increment in HDL values in the exercise group (0.18 ± 0.14 vs. 0.07 ± 0.12 mmol/L, P = 0.014; exercise vs. control).

672,32367183,Perceptions of a Health Care Notebook from Female Breast Cancer Survivors with Cognitive Impairment.,"Strengthening communication between providers and patients, especially those with cognitive impairment, is required given care complexity and fragmentation across the care continuum. Therefore, determining patient perceptions about the Siebens Health Care Notebook (SHCN), a tool to support self-management and strengthen communication and care continuity, is fundamental to understanding SHCN usability. Participants were breast cancer survivors in a study evaluating a 6-week cognitive rehabilitation program, who reported cancer-related cognitive impairment (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function-Perceived Cognitive Impairment (PCI) subscale < 59). Participant groups were alternately assigned to receive the SHCN (intervention) or not (control). SHCN recipients completed a 3-item qualitative perception survey at program completion. Both groups were surveyed at baseline, program completion, and 4 weeks later about communication with physicians. Scores were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. No baseline demographic or PCI score differences occurred between intervention (n = 29) and control (n = 16) groups. Of 22 (76%) who completed the SHCN perception survey, 100% endorsed it as useful in tracking health information, as helpful, and would recommend it to others. No group differences in communication activities with physicians were demonstrated. Women reporting cognitive impairment after breast cancer treatment perceived the SHCN as a beneficial self-care tool and would suggest it to others. Communication activities with physicians did not change during the study's short duration. Future research is needed to evaluate SHCN features contributing to helpfulness and details on use, including two-way communication activities between patients and physicians, across the care continuum.",2020,No baseline demographic or PCI score differences occurred between intervention (n = 29) and control (n = 16) groups.,"['Female Breast Cancer Survivors with Cognitive Impairment', 'Participants were breast cancer survivors in a study evaluating a 6-week cognitive rehabilitation program, who reported cancer-related cognitive impairment (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function-Perceived Cognitive Impairment (PCI) subscale <\u200959']","['SHCN (intervention) or not (control', 'SHCN', 'Health Care Notebook']","['communication activities', 'baseline demographic or PCI score differences']","[{'cui': 'C0235653', 'cui_str': 'Malignant neoplasm of female breast'}, {'cui': 'C0206194', 'cui_str': 'Survivors'}, {'cui': 'C0338656', 'cui_str': 'Impaired cognition'}, {'cui': 'C0006142', 'cui_str': 'Malignant tumor of breast'}, {'cui': 'C0008972', 'cui_str': 'Clinical Study'}, {'cui': 'C0439230', 'cui_str': 'week'}, {'cui': 'C0870303', 'cui_str': 'Cognitive rehabilitation'}, {'cui': 'C0018106', 'cui_str': 'Government Programs'}, {'cui': 'C0684224', 'cui_str': 'Report'}, {'cui': 'C0006826', 'cui_str': 'Malignant neoplastic disease'}, {'cui': 'C0278372', 'cui_str': 'Functional assessment'}, {'cui': 'C0009244', 'cui_str': 'Cognitive therapy'}, {'cui': 'C0031843', 'cui_str': 'PH'}, {'cui': 'C0030971', 'cui_str': 'Perception'}]","[{'cui': 'C0086388', 'cui_str': 'Healthcare'}, {'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}]","[{'cui': 'C0009452', 'cui_str': 'Communication'}, {'cui': 'C0026606', 'cui_str': 'Physical activity'}, {'cui': 'C0168634', 'cui_str': 'BaseLine dental cement'}, {'cui': 'C0011298', 'cui_str': 'Demographics'}, {'cui': 'C1532338', 'cui_str': 'Percutaneous coronary intervention'}, {'cui': 'C0449820', 'cui_str': 'Score'}]",,0.0186015,No baseline demographic or PCI score differences occurred between intervention (n = 29) and control (n = 16) groups.,"[{'ForeName': 'Pamela', 'Initials': 'P', 'LastName': 'Moyo', 'Affiliation': 'Loma Linda University, 11130 Anderson St, Loma Linda, CA, 92354, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Darrell', 'Initials': 'D', 'LastName': 'Walters', 'Affiliation': 'Fuller Graduate School of Psychology, 180 North Oakland Avenue, Pasadena, CA, 91101, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Hilary C', 'Initials': 'HC', 'LastName': 'Siebens', 'Affiliation': 'Siebens Patient Care Communications LLC, 13650 Del Monte Dr Ste 32C, Seal Beach, CA, 90740, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jamie', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Myers', 'Affiliation': 'University of Kansas School of Nursing, 3901 Rainbow Blvd, MS3031, Kansas City, KS, 66160, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Rachel', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Baynes', 'Affiliation': 'Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 8700 Beverly Blvd, Los Angeles, CA, 90048, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Galen', 'Initials': 'G', 'LastName': 'Cook-Wiens', 'Affiliation': 'Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 8700 Beverly Blvd, Los Angeles, CA, 90048, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Mi-Yeoung', 'Initials': 'MY', 'LastName': 'Jo', 'Affiliation': 'Jo NeuroAssessment Center, Inc., 15335 Morrison Street, Suite 205, Sherman Oaks, CA, 91403, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Arash', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Asher', 'Affiliation': 'Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 8700 Beverly Blvd, Los Angeles, CA, 90048, USA.

Effects of training with free weights versus machines on muscle mass, strength, free testosterone, and free cortisol levels. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2020-Free weights offer a more unstable training environment, which enhances muscle recruitment, whereas some machines have the advantage of using a ""cam"" pulley system that better matches strength curves. We compared the effect of training with free weights vs. machines on muscle mass, strength, free testosterone, and free cortisol concentrations. Forty-six subjects (26 women; 22 ± 3 years) were randomized to train using free weights or machines for 8 weeks (with each muscle group trained 2-3/weeks, 3-4 sets of 4-10 repetitions). Muscle thickness and strength were measured at 0 and 8 weeks. Salivary hormone concentrations were assessed before and at the end of workouts at the beginning, midway (4 weeks), and end (8 weeks) of the training intervention. Biceps and quadriceps muscle thickness increased (p < 0.01) with no difference between groups. There was a group × time interaction for machine bench press strength (p = 0.05) with the machine group increasing more than the free-weight group (13.9 vs. 8.6%).

676,32358379,Efficacy assessment of acupuncture in improving symptoms of uterine fibroids: A randomized controlled trial.,"INTRODUCTION


Uterine fibroids are a common benign genital tumor disease in gynecological diseases. It is mainly a change in physical function caused by the growth of smooth muscle cells in the factor uterus. Modern medicine's treatment of this disease is based on the dependence of uterine fibroids on sex hormones. Treatment with antiprogestin and estrogen drugs can reduce the volume of fibroids or slow the rate of increase in volume, thereby achieving the goal of alleviating clinical symptoms. In order to meet the needs of the majority of women of childbearing age and to maintain fertility, acupuncture treatment of uterine fibroids has a broad prospect for development.
METHODS/DESIGN


This study plans to select 60 cases that meet the corresponding selection criteria. According to the random principle, they will be divided into intervention group and control group, with 30 cases in each group. The general information, fibroid size, and TCM syndrome scores of the two groups of patients will be compared before treatment. In terms of treatment, the intervention group will be given acupuncture combined therapy; the control group will be given Chinese patent medicine. The treatment cycles in both groups will be three menstrual cycles. After the treatment is completed, the data of the relevant curative effect indicators are analyzed by using SPSS software to draw conclusions.
DISCUSSION


We aim to provide higher evidence-based medical evidence for acupuncture treatment of uterine fibroids.

678,32358383,Traditional Chinese medicine may reduce the dosage of systemic glucocorticoids in required patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Study protocol for a randomized placebo-controlled trial.,"INTRODUCTION


Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) involves a severe inflammatory response. Systemic glucocorticoids are very important for the treatment of the acute exacerbation period; however, their use causes serious adverse effects. There is still no evidence on whether traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can be used to reduce the dosage of systemic glucocorticoids in the treatment of patients with AECOPD.
METHODS


In this trial, we plan to enroll 204 eligible patients with AECOPD who will be randomly assigned to receive TCM or a placebo. The effect of TCM in the treatment of patients with AECOPD will be measured by the dosage of systemic glucocorticoids (at which COPD assessment test [CAT] scores improve by 50%). Safety will also be assessed.

680,32358398,Eye-acupuncture with rehabilitation therapy for stroke.,"BACKGROUND


Stroke survivors are accompanied by dysfunctions, greatly declining their activities of daily living and bringing burden to families and societies. Although modern rehabilitation therapy has a systematic program in post-stroke motor rehabilitation, numbers of patients still recover slowly. Eye-acupuncture (EA), as an important type of acupuncture, has been widely applied effectively in rehabilitation of stroke for about 50 years. So we combine EA with modern rehabilitation which has achieved successful results. Therefore, we need to adopt an objective and accurate evaluation method to study the effect of this method.
METHODS


We aim to design a multi-center, block randomized, parallel control trial to assess the effect of eye-acupuncture combined with rehabilitation training therapy for patients with hemiplegia in the convalescent stage of stroke. 360 patients will be enrolled from 6 centres, with half of them (n = 180) in the control group (routine treatment group) and others (n = 180) in the experimental group (eye-acupuncture combined with routine treatment group). Stratified block randomization will be used in the study and the serial number 001-360 which corresponds to a participant will be assigned to each center randomly. We will use the sequentially sealed envelopes to hide the generating of assignment sequence. The cases of dropouts will be recorded with reasons. And the clinical CRFs will be filled in accurately, completely, and timely for statistical analysis.
RESULTS


To verify the clinical effects, we will measure the change of bellows from visit 1 to visit 4. Primary outcomes: activity of daily living (ADL) scales (modified Barthel index); simple Fugl-Meyer motor function score; functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain in the resting state.
SECONDARY OUTCOMES


traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome score scale; western aphasia battery (WAB); water swallow test; Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA); growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43); microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2).
CONCLUSION


The results of this study will provide present evidence on assessing effectiveness of EA combined with rehabilitation training for patients with hemiplegia in the convalescent stage of stroke.

681,32358482,Postprandial blood glucose response: does the glycaemic index (GI) value matter even in the low GI range?,"A growing body of research over the last decades has shown that diets based on the low glycaemic index (GI) foods reduce the risk of developing diabetes and improve blood glucose control in people with diabetes. The range of inflexion on the glycaemic response of low GI (LGI) foods is an interesting observation that has not been studied by many. LGI 1 (GI 54 ± 3.3) biscuit was formulated using a basic formulation while the LGI 2 (23.8 ± 3.3) biscuits was a modification of LGI 1 recipe, formulated with the inclusion of functional ingredients. Biscuits were formulated to be iso-caloric (kcal/100 g: 521 ± 12). Each participant consumed identical standard meals for lunch and dinner. Biscuits were consumed as breakfast and mid-afternoon snack. Using a randomized, controlled, crossover study, 13 males [(means ± SD) age: 25.3 ± 1.0 years, BMI 21.6 ± 0.5 kg/m 2 , fasting blood glucose 4.7 ± 0.1 mmol/L] wore continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS™) for 3 days for each test session. The postprandial glycaemic response and insulin response were compared within participants. Total iAUC for breakfast and standard dinner were significantly lower for LGI 2 treatment (p < 0.05) than LGI 1 treatment. Second-meal glucose tolerance was observed at the dinner meal. The overall iAUC insulin response over 180 min was significantly lower for LGI 2 biscuits (p = 0.01). The postprandial glycaemic response of two types of biscuits that fall within the low GI classification (GI 24 and 54) differed with LGI 2 biscuits (GI 24) showing a more suppressed postprandial glycaemic response.

683,32358608,Online Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for People with Painful Diabetic Neuropathy in the United Kingdom: A Single-Arm Feasibility Trial.,"OBJECTIVE


This study aimed to assess the feasibility of online Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for painful diabetic neuropathy in the United Kingdom and to determine if a larger randomized controlled trial testing treatment efficacy is justified.
METHODS


Participants with painful diabetic neuropathy were recruited online and from hospital services. This was a single-arm study in which all participants received online Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. Participants completed questionnaires at baseline and three months post-treatment. Primary feasibility outcomes were recruitment, retention, and treatment completion rates. Secondary outcomes were pre- to post-treatment effects on pain outcomes and psychological flexibility.
RESULTS


Of 225 potentially eligible participants, 30 took part in this study. Regarding primary feasibility outcomes, the treatment completion and follow-up questionnaire completion rates were 40% and 100%, respectively. Generally, at baseline those who completed the treatment, compared with those who did not, had better daily functioning and higher psychological flexibility. With respect to secondary outcomes, results from the completers group showed clinically meaningful effects at post-treatment for 100% of participants for pain intensity and pain distress, 66.7% for depressive symptoms, 58.3% for functional impairment, 41.7% for cognitive fusion, 66.7% for committed action, 58.3% for self-as-context, and 41.7% for pain acceptance.
CONCLUSIONS


This preliminary trial suggests feasibility of recruitment and follow-up questionnaire completion rates, supporting planning for a larger randomized controlled trial. However, treatment completion rates did not achieve the prespecified feasibility target.

684,32294771,Preventing Diagnostic Errors in Ambulatory Care: An Electronic Notification Tool for Incomplete Radiology Tests.,"BACKGROUND


Failure to complete recommended diagnostic tests may increase the risk of diagnostic errors.
OBJECTIVES


The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate an electronic monitoring tool that notifies the responsible clinician of incomplete imaging tests for their ambulatory patients.
METHODS


A results notification workflow engine was created at an academic medical center. It identified future appointments for imaging studies and notified the ordering physician of incomplete tests by secure email. To assess the impact of the intervention, the project team surveyed participating physicians and measured test completion rates within 90 days of the scheduled appointment. Analyses compared test completion rates among patients of intervention and usual care clinicians at baseline and follow-up. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to control for secular trends and differences between cohorts.
RESULTS


A total of 725 patients of 16 intervention physicians had 1,016 delayed imaging studies; 2,023 patients of 42 usual care clinicians had 2,697 delayed studies. In the first month, physicians indicated in 23/30 cases that they were unaware of the missed test prior to notification. The 90-day test completion rate was lower in the usual care than intervention group in the 6-month baseline period (18.8 vs. 22.1%,  p  = 0.119). During the 12-month follow-up period, there was a significant improvement favoring the intervention group (20.9 vs. 25.5%,  p  = 0.027). The change was driven by improved completion rates among patients referred for mammography (21.0 vs. 30.1%,  p  = 0.003). Multivariate analyses showed no significant impact of the intervention.
CONCLUSION

686,32358638,Transcutaneous Stimulation of Auricular Branch of the Vagus Nerve Attenuates the Acute Inflammatory Response After Lung Lobectomy.,"OBJECTIVES


Systemic inflammation is a potentially debilitating complication of thoracic surgeries with significant physical and economic morbidity. There is compelling evidence for the role of the central nervous system in regulating inflammatory processes through humoral mechanisms. Activation of the afferent vagus nerve by cytokines triggers anti-inflammatory responses. Peripheral electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve in vivo during lethal endotoxemia in rats inhibited tumor necrosis factor synthesis and prevented shock development. However, the vagal regulatory role of systemic inflammation after lung lobectomy is unknown.
METHODS


One hundred patients who underwent lobectomy via thoracotomy were recruited and equally randomized to treated group or controls. Intermittent stimulation of the auricular branch of vagus nerve in the triangular fossa was applied in the treated group using neurostimulator V (Ducest ® , Germany), starting 24 h preoperatively and continued till the 4th postoperative day (POD). Inflammatory interleukins (IL) were analyzed using ELISA preoperatively, on the 1st and 4th POD.
RESULTS


On the 1st POD, patients who underwent neurostimulation had reduced serum concentrations of CRP (p = 0.01), IL6 (p = 0.02) but elevated IL10 (p = 0.03) versus controls. On the 4th POD, serum concentrations of CRP, IL6 and IL10 were similar in both groups. Moreover, the treated group was associated with lower incidence of pneumonia (p = 0.04) and shorter hospitalization time (p = 0.04) versus controls.
CONCLUSIONS


Modulations in the brain stem caused by noninvasive transcutaneous stimulation of the vagus nerve after lung lobectomy attenuate the acute postsurgical inflammatory response by the regulation of IL6 and IL10, resulting in  reduced incidence of postoperative pneumonia and short hospitalization time.

687,32359899,Influence of lipoproteins and antiplatelet agents on vein graft patency 1 year after coronary artery bypass grafting.,"OBJECTIVE


It remains unclear whether aggressive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) management (<1.8 mmol/L) can slow the process of vein graft stenosis. This study aimed to explore the impact of baseline LDL-C levels on vein graft patency in patients on ticagrelor with or without aspirin 1 year after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
METHODS


This was a post hoc analysis of the DACAB (Different Antiplatelet Therapy Strategy After Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery) trial (NCT02201771), a randomized controlled trial (ticagrelor + aspirin or ticagrelor vs aspirin) of patients undergoing CABG in China. The study subjects were stratified as LDL-low (baseline LDL-C <1.8 mmol/L, 148 patients with 430 vein grafts) versus LDL-high (baseline LDL-C ≥1.8 mmol/L, 352 patients with 1030 vein grafts). The primary outcome was the 1-year vein graft patency (Fitzgibbon grade A) assessed by coronary computed tomographic angiography or coronary angiography.
RESULTS


Baseline/1-year LDL-C were 1.4/1.6 and 2.6/2.4 mmol/L in the LDL-low and LDL-high subgroups, respectively. Regardless of antiplatelet regimen, no significant inter-subgroup difference was observed for 1-year graft patency (LDL-low: 83.8% [359/430 grafts]; LDL-high: 82.3% [848/1030 grafts]; adjusted OR for non-patency [OR adj ], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-1.50, P = .857). For both subgroups, the 1-year graft patency rates were greater with ticagrelor + aspirin versus aspirin (LDL-low: OR adj , 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17-0.97; LDL-high: OR adj , 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.71; inter P = .679).
CONCLUSIONS


In general, baseline LDL-C is not associated with 1-year vein graft patency after CABG. Regardless of the baseline LDL-C levels, ticagrelor + aspirin was superior to aspirin alone in maintaining vein graft patency. The primary factor causing early vein graft disease might not be atherosclerosis but thrombosis.",2020,"Regardless of the baseline LDL-C levels, ticagrelor + aspirin was superior to aspirin alone in maintaining vein graft patency.","['148 patients with 430 vein grafts) versus LDL-high (baseline LDL-C ≥1.8\xa0mmol/L, 352 patients with 1030 vein grafts', 'patients undergoing CABG in China', 'vein graft patency 1\xa0year after coronary artery bypass grafting', 'patients on ticagrelor with or without aspirin 1\xa0year after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG']","['ticagrelor\xa0+\xa0aspirin or ticagrelor vs aspirin', 'lipoproteins and antiplatelet agents', 'aspirin', 'ticagrelor\xa0+\xa0aspirin']","['1-year graft patency rates', 'aggressive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) management', '1-year vein graft patency', '1-year vein graft patency (Fitzgibbon grade A) assessed by coronary computed tomographic angiography or coronary angiography', '1-year graft patency']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0042449', 'cui_str': 'Venous structure'}, {'cui': 'C0181074', 'cui_str': 'Graft material'}, {'cui': 'C0023169', 'cui_str': 'LDL(1)'}, {'cui': 'C0205250', 'cui_str': 'High'}, {'cui': 'C0168634', 'cui_str': 'BaseLine dental cement'}, {'cui': 'C0023824', 'cui_str': 'LDL cholesterol'}, {'cui': 'C1532563', 'cui_str': 'mmol/L'}, {'cui': 'C0010055', 'cui_str': 'Coronary artery bypass graft'}, {'cui': 'C0008115', 'cui_str': 'China'}, {'cui': 'C0175566', 'cui_str': 'Open'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C1999375', 'cui_str': 'Ticagrelor'}, {'cui': 'C0004057', 'cui_str': 'Aspirin'}]","[{'cui': 'C1999375', 'cui_str': 'Ticagrelor'}, {'cui': 'C0004057', 'cui_str': 'Aspirin'}, {'cui': 'C0023820', 'cui_str': 'Lipoprotein'}, {'cui': 'C0085826', 'cui_str': 'Antiplatelet agent'}]","[{'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0181074', 'cui_str': 'Graft material'}, {'cui': 'C0175566', 'cui_str': 'Open'}, {'cui': 'C0001807', 'cui_str': 'Aggressive behavior'}, {'cui': 'C0023824', 'cui_str': 'LDL cholesterol'}, {'cui': 'C0001554', 'cui_str': 'Administration'}, {'cui': 'C0042449', 'cui_str': 'Venous structure'}, {'cui': 'C0309195', 'cui_str': 'Grade A'}, {'cui': 'C0018787', 'cui_str': 'Heart structure'}, {'cui': 'C1536105', 'cui_str': 'CT angiography'}, {'cui': 'C0085532', 'cui_str': 'Coronary angiography'}]",148.0,0.186856,"Regardless of the baseline LDL-C levels, ticagrelor + aspirin was superior to aspirin alone in maintaining vein graft patency.","[{'ForeName': 'Jiaxi', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Zhu', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Ruijin Hospital Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Yunpeng', 'Initials': 'Y', 'LastName': 'Zhu', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Ruijin Hospital Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Minlu', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Zhang', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cancer Control and Prevention, Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shanghai, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Qing', 'Initials': 'Q', 'LastName': 'Xue', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Changhai Hospital of Shanghai, Shanghai, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Junlong', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Hu', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Fuwai Central China Cardiovascular Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Hao', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Liu', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Xinhua Hospital Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Rui', 'Initials': 'R', 'LastName': 'Wang', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Nanjing First Hospital, Nanjing, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Xiaowei', 'Initials': 'X', 'LastName': 'Wang', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.'}, {'ForeName': 'Qiang', 'Initials': 'Q', 'LastName': 'Zhao', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Ruijin Hospital Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.

688,32360105,Innovative Devices Did Not Provide Superior Total Knee Arthroplasty Outcomes in Post-Operative Rehabilitation: Results From a Four-Arm Randomized Clinical Trial.,"BACKGROUND


Orthopedic surgeons face an increasing array of post-TKA (total knee arthroplasty) rehabilitation interventions that entail innovative equipment and devices, but their relative effectiveness remains unknown. The study compared patient outcomes among primary unilateral TKA patients participating in one of 4 post-TKA rehabilitation interventions-a standard-of-care intervention and 3 more recently developed physical therapy interventions.
METHODS


The Knee Arthroplasty Rehabilitation Outcomes Study is a 4-arm randomized clinical trial conducted across 15 outpatient rehabilitation clinics. The trial evaluated 4 alternative interventions: (1) a stationary recumbent bike (control intervention); (2) a body weight-adjustable treadmill; (3) a recumbent bike and use of a patterned electrical neuromuscular stimulation device; and (4) a body weight-adjustable treadmill and a patterned electrical neuromuscular stimulation device. The study's outcome measures were patient walking speed and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) measured at therapy discharge and at follow-up.
RESULTS


The study enrolled 363 TKA patients with 90-92 patients in each of the 4 study arms. Participants were similar across the 4 groups: They were about 63 years old, 61% female, 67% white, living at home, overweight (mean body mass index = 31.6), with mostly private insurance (61%) or Medicare (32%). Walking speed was similar at admission and discharge; KOOS scores were similar at admission, discharge, and follow-up across the 4 intervention groups.
CONCLUSION


The study found no statistical or clinically meaningful differences across the 4 study arms in walking speed or KOOS outcomes. Clinicians, payers, and policy makers will want to encourage providers and patients to use the least expensive intervention since each provide similar outcomes.

This study was conducted to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial efficacy of green tea and its extract epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) as a mouthwash in children.
DESIGN


The study group included 47 children aged 5-12 years at high caries risk and prevalence. Children selected were asked to rinse with one of the substances (EGCG, green tea, chlorhexidine and distilled water) for one min. A non-stimulated salivary sample (2 mL) was collected at baseline and after rinsing. The concentration of cariogenic microorganisms (mutans streptococci and lactobacilli) was determined before and after rinsing based on the count of colony-forming units (CFU). CFU were counted with the aid of a stereomicroscope through the perfunctory identification of the morphological characteristics of CFU. The microbial reduction percentage was then calculated.
RESULTS


The analysis of the effectiveness of the treatments showed that there was a significant reduction in relation to the values obtained before and after the mouthwash, both for mutans streptococci (pCHX = 0.001; pEGCG = 0.001; pGreen Tea = 0.005; pDistilled Water = 0.018) and lactobacilli (pCHX = 0.001; pEGCG = 0.002; pGreen Tea = 0.008; pDistilled Water = 0.033). The percentage of microbial reduction of both cariogenic microorganisms caused by the EGCG solution was higher than green tea and distilled water, but less than CHX. The percentage of microbial reduction by the EGCG solution for mutans streptococci was 79.9%, green tea 68.3%, distilled water 50.6% and CHX 95.5%. For lactobacilli, the percentage reduction of all solutions was relatively lower when compared to mutans streptococci. For the EGCG solution it was 72.09%, followed by green tea 59.17% and distilled water 41.96%, but less than CHX 86.02%.
CONCLUSION


Rinsing with EGCG solution reduced the levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the oral cavity of children. Although EGCG had better antimicrobial activity than green tea, this study supports the effectiveness of both as an antibacterial mouthwash option.

690,32361126,Kinetic parameters during land and water walking performed by individuals with Down Syndrome.,"BACKGROUND


Down Syndrome (DS) is a genetic condition presenting delay in acquisition of main motor milestones, such as walking. Although studies have been investigating the biomechanical parameters during land walking performed by individual with DS, the literature is scarce regarding kinetic parameters analysis in this population, specially during water walking.
RESEARCH QUESTION


This study sought to assess the vertical ground reaction force (Fz) of walking performed in water and on land at different speeds by individuals with DS.
METHODS


Fourteen adults with DS (age: 27.9 ± 7.9 years; body mass: 58.4 ± 12.9 kg; height: 1.4 ± 0.1 m, body mass index: 29.2 ± 5.4 kg.m -2 ) completed two sessions of data collection, one on land and another in aquatic environment. The protocol consisted of walking performed at three self-selected speeds (slow, comfortable and fast) in randomized order. The Fz was assessed with a waterproof force plate in each condition. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA (environment and speed), with Bonferroni's post hoc tests, were used for analysis. A significance level was set as α = 0.05.
RESULTS


Significant differences were observed between environments (p < 0.001), with reduced first peak of Fz (68-73%), second peak of Fz (66-70%), loading rate (75-78%) and impulse (40-41%) in the water walking for all speeds analyzed. In the aquatic environment, no significant difference was observed for the first and second Fz peaks with the increasing speed of walking. Moreover, the loading rate significantly increased (p = 0.019) as the impulse significantly reduced (p < 0.001) in the higher speeds.
SIGNIFICANCE


Individuals with DS present reduced Fz outcomes during water walking in comparison to land. Therefore, water walking may be performed by individuals with DS with safe vertical loads on lower limbs regardless the self-selected speed for rehabilitation, correction of gait and training purposes.",2020,"In the aquatic environment, no significant difference was observed for the first and second Fz peaks with the increasing speed of walking.","['individuals with DS', 'individuals with Down Syndrome', 'Individuals with DS present', 'Fourteen adults with DS (age: 27.9\u2009±\u20097.9 years; body mass: 58.4\u2009±\u200912.9\u2009kg; height: 1.4\u2009±\u20090.1\u2009m, body mass index: 29.2\u2009±\u20095.4\u2009kg.m -2 ) completed two sessions of data collection, one on land and another in aquatic environment']",['vertical ground reaction force (Fz) of walking performed in water and on land'],"['speed of walking', 'second peak of Fz', 'reduced Fz outcomes', 'loading rate']","[{'cui': 'C0027361', 'cui_str': 'Person'}, {'cui': 'C0013080', 'cui_str': 'Trisomy 21'}, {'cui': 'C0150312', 'cui_str': 'Present'}, {'cui': 'C3715152', 'cui_str': '14'}, {'cui': 'C0001675', 'cui_str': 'Adult'}, {'cui': 'C0001779', 'cui_str': 'Age'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0152338', 'cui_str': 'Structure of body of caudate nucleus'}, {'cui': 'C0577559', 'cui_str': 'Mass of body structure'}, {'cui': 'C0005890', 'cui_str': 'Body height measure'}, {'cui': 'C4517503', 'cui_str': '1.4'}, {'cui': 'C4517420', 'cui_str': '0.1'}, {'cui': 'C0005893', 'cui_str': 'Body mass index'}, {'cui': 'C4517792', 'cui_str': '5.4'}, {'cui': 'C0205197', 'cui_str': 'Complete'}, {'cui': 'C0010995', 'cui_str': 'Data Collection'}, {'cui': 'C0557668', 'cui_str': 'Landing'}, {'cui': 'C0563034', 'cui_str': 'Aquatic environment'}]","[{'cui': 'C0205128', 'cui_str': 'Vertical'}, {'cui': 'C0443286', 'cui_str': 'Reaction'}, {'cui': 'C0443221', 'cui_str': 'Forced'}, {'cui': 'C0884358', 'cui_str': 'Performed'}, {'cui': 'C0020311', 'cui_str': 'Hydrotherapy'}, {'cui': 'C0557668', 'cui_str': 'Landing'}]","[{'cui': 'C0025611', 'cui_str': 'Methamphetamine'}, {'cui': 'C0205436', 'cui_str': 'Second'}, {'cui': 'C0444505', 'cui_str': 'Peak'}, {'cui': 'C0392756', 'cui_str': 'Reduced'}, {'cui': 'C1274040', 'cui_str': 'Result'}]",14.0,0.0231467,"In the aquatic environment, no significant difference was observed for the first and second Fz peaks with the increasing speed of walking.","[{'ForeName': 'Gabriela Neves', 'Initials': 'GN', 'LastName': 'Nunes', 'Affiliation': 'Federal University of Pelotas, Department of Sports, Pelotas, Brazil.'}, {'ForeName': 'Stephanie Santana', 'Initials': 'SS', 'LastName': 'Pinto', 'Affiliation': 'Federal University of Pelotas, Department of Sports, Pelotas, Brazil.'}, {'ForeName': 'Gabriele Randuz', 'Initials': 'GR', 'LastName': 'Krüger', 'Affiliation': 'Federal University of Pelotas, Department of Sports, Pelotas, Brazil.'}, {'ForeName': 'Leonardo Alexandre', 'Initials': 'LA', 'LastName': 'Peyré-Tartaruga', 'Affiliation': 'Exercise Research Laboratory, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.'}, {'ForeName': 'Luana Siqueira', 'Initials': 'LS', 'LastName': 'Andrade', 'Affiliation': 'Federal University of Pelotas, Department of Sports, Pelotas, Brazil.'}, {'ForeName': 'Graciele Ferreira', 'Initials': 'GF', 'LastName': 'Mendes', 'Affiliation': 'Federal University of Pelotas, Department of Sports, Pelotas, Brazil.'}, {'ForeName': 'Vitor de Lima', 'Initials': 'VL', 'LastName': 'Krüger', 'Affiliation': 'Federal University of Pelotas, Department of Sports, Pelotas, Brazil.'}, {'ForeName': 'Rochele Barboza', 'Initials': 'RB', 'LastName': 'Pinheiro', 'Affiliation': 'Federal University of Pelotas, Department of Sports, Pelotas, Brazil.'}, {'ForeName': 'Alexandre Carriconde', 'Initials': 'AC', 'LastName': 'Marques', 'Affiliation': 'Federal University of Pelotas, Department of Sports, Pelotas, Brazil.'}, {'ForeName': 'Cristine Lima', 'Initials': 'CL', 'LastName': 'Alberton', 'Affiliation': 'Federal University of Pelotas, Department of Sports, Pelotas, Brazil.

692,32358376,Study of efficacy and safety of Jiaotai pill in the treatment of depression.,"BACKGROUND


Depression is a common affective disorder characterized by marked and lasting melancholia, with corresponding thought and behavior changes. Due to an accelerated pace of life and increased work pressure, the incidence of depression has risen sharply, causing great harm to family and social life. Jiaotai pill (JTP) is a Chinese herbal formula that is commonly prescribed for depression and insomnia in clinical treatment, and exhibits antidepressant effects as shown in animal experimental research. However, there are no standard clinical trials to confirm its efficacy in treating depression.
OBJECTIVE


This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of JTP in the treatment of depression, so as to tap the clinical efficacy advantages of JTP and provide data support for its clinical application.
METHODS


A randomized, multicenter clinical trial with parallel groups was designed in this study. A total of 40 patients with depression were included and randomly divided to either the treatment or the control group with a ratio of 1:1. The patients received JTP plus fluoxetine or fluoxetine alone once per day for 8 weeks. The primary outcome included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score for patients and brain structure and function by functional magnetic resonance imaging. The secondary outcomes included Traditional Chinese medicine syndrome integral scale scores, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, blood metabonomics, urine metabonomics.
CONCLUSION


The results of this trial will find changes in brain structure, brain function, and metabolism in patients with depression, and provide critical evidence for JTP in the treatment of depression.",2020,A total of 40 patients with depression were included and randomly divided to either the treatment or the control group with a ratio of 1:1.,"['40 patients with depression', 'patients with depression']","['JTP', 'JTP plus fluoxetine or fluoxetine', 'Jiaotai pill', 'Jiaotai pill (JTP']","['efficacy and safety', 'Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score for patients and brain structure and function by functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'Traditional Chinese medicine syndrome integral scale scores, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, blood metabonomics, urine metabonomics']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0011570', 'cui_str': 'Depression'}]","[{'cui': 'C3852419', 'cui_str': 'jiaotai'}, {'cui': 'C0009905', 'cui_str': 'Oral Contraceptives'}, {'cui': 'C0332287', 'cui_str': 'With'}, {'cui': 'C0016365', 'cui_str': 'Fluoxetine'}]","[{'cui': 'C1280519', 'cui_str': 'Effectiveness'}, {'cui': 'C0036043', 'cui_str': 'Safety'}, {'cui': 'C0451203', 'cui_str': 'Hamilton rating scale for depression'}, {'cui': 'C0449820', 'cui_str': 'Score'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0006104', 'cui_str': 'Brain structure'}, {'cui': 'C0031843', 'cui_str': 'PH'}, {'cui': 'C0376335', 'cui_str': 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Functional'}, {'cui': 'C0025124', 'cui_str': 'Traditional Chinese Medicine'}, {'cui': 'C0039082', 'cui_str': 'Symptom Cluster'}, {'cui': 'C0443238', 'cui_str': 'Integral'}, {'cui': 'C0175659', 'cui_str': 'Scale'}, {'cui': 'C0451592', 'cui_str': 'Wisconsin card sorting test'}, {'cui': 'C0005767', 'cui_str': 'Blood'}, {'cui': 'C1956136', 'cui_str': 'Metabonomics'}, {'cui': 'C0042036', 'cui_str': 'Urine'}]",40.0,0.108319,A total of 40 patients with depression were included and randomly divided to either the treatment or the control group with a ratio of 1:1.,"[{'ForeName': 'Zhihuan', 'Initials': 'Z', 'LastName': 'Zhou', 'Affiliation': 'College of Traditional Chinese Medicine.'}, {'ForeName': 'Shufei', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Fu', 'Affiliation': 'College of Traditional Chinese Medicine.'}, {'ForeName': 'Yijia', 'Initials': 'Y', 'LastName': 'Liu', 'Affiliation': 'Graduate School, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine.'}, {'ForeName': 'Yuhan', 'Initials': 'Y', 'LastName': 'Wang', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychosomatic Disease, Tianjin Hospital of ITCWM Nankai Hospital.'}, {'ForeName': 'Huaien', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Bu', 'Affiliation': 'College of Traditional Chinese Medicine.'}, {'ForeName': 'Yan', 'Initials': 'Y', 'LastName': 'Mei', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychosomatic Disease, Tianjin Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated Hospital.'}, {'ForeName': 'Yi', 'Initials': 'Y', 'LastName': 'Tong', 'Affiliation': 'Clinical Department, First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine.'}, {'ForeName': 'Chunquan', 'Initials': 'C', 'LastName': 'Yu', 'Affiliation': 'Editorial Department, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China.'}]",Medicine,['10.1097/MD.0000000000019999']
693,32358413,Romosozumab in Skeletally Mature Adults with a Fresh Unilateral Tibial Diaphyseal Fracture: A Randomized Phase-2 Study.,"BACKGROUND


Romosozumab is an antibody that binds and inhibits sclerostin, thereby increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption. A double-blinded, randomized, phase-2, dose-finding trial was performed to evaluate the effect of romosozumab on the radiographic and clinical outcomes of surgical fixation of tibial diaphyseal fractures.
METHODS


Patients (18 to 82 years old) were randomized 3:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 to a placebo or 1 of 9 romosozumab treatment groups. Patients received subcutaneous injections of romosozumab or the placebo postoperatively on day 1 and weeks 2, 6, and 12. The primary outcome was the time to radiographic evidence of healing (""radiographic healing"") analyzed after the week-24 assessments had been completed for all patients.
RESULTS


A total of 402 patients were randomized: 299 to the romosozumab group and 103 to the placebo group. The median time to radiographic healing (the primary outcome) ranged from 14.4 to 18.6 weeks in the romosozumab groups and was 16.4 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.6 to 18.0 weeks) in the placebo group, which was not a significant difference. There was also no significant difference in the median time to clinical healing, no relationship between romosozumab dose/frequency and unplanned revision surgery, and no apparent treatment benefit in terms of physical function. The safety and tolerability profile of romosozumab was comparable with that of the placebo.
CONCLUSIONS


Romosozumab did not accelerate tibial fracture-healing in this patient population. Additional studies of patients at higher risk for delayed healing are needed to explore the potential of romosozumab to accelerate tibial fracture-healing.

694,32358417,Excisional goniotomy vs trabecular microbypass stent implantation: A prospective randomized clinical trial in eyes with mild to moderate open-angle glaucoma.,"PURPOSE


To compare reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) and IOP-lowering medication in eyes undergoing excisional goniotomy with Kahook Dual Blade v iStent microbypass implantation, both combined with phacoemulsification, in eyes with mild-moderate open-angle glaucoma (OAG).
SETTING


Nine practices in the United States.
DESIGN


Prospective, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial.
METHODS


Eyes were randomized to KDB-Phaco or iStent-Phaco. Demographics, corrected distance visual acuity, IOP, IOP-lowering medications, and adverse events were collected at baseline, and at day 1, week 1, and months 1, 3, 6, and 12 postoperatively. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of eyes at month 12 with IOP reduction >20% or IOP medication reduction >1 compared with baseline.
RESULTS


For this study, 164 eyes/164 patient were analyzed (82 in each group). Mean IOP was reduced at Mmonth 12 compared with baseline from 18.5 (SE 0.4) to 15.4 (0.4) mmHg in the KDB-Phaco group and from 18.5 (0.3) to 16.1 (0.4) mmHg in the iStent-Phaco-group (p=0.24). Mean IOP-lowering medications were reduced from 1.3 (0.1) to 0.3 (0.1) in the KDB-Phaco group and from 1.4 (0.1) to 0.4 (0.1) in the iStent-Phaco group (p=0.17). Among study completers, the primary outcome was attained in 93.7% (74/79) of KDB-Phaco eyes and 83.3% (65/78) of iStent-Phaco eyes (p=0.04). Both procedures had similar safety profiles.

To determine the effect of the fascia iliaca block (FIB) on patients undergoing surgery for hip fractures.
DESIGN


Prospective, randomized controlled trial SETTING:: Level I trauma center.
PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS


Patients (N = 97) undergoing surgery for hip fractures were prospectively randomized to receive either a perioperative FIB (FIB group) or receive no block (control group) from February 2018 to April 2019.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES


visual analog score (VAS), morphine milligram equivalents (MME), post-operative ambulatory distance RESULTS:: Fifty-seven patients were randomized to the FIB group and 40 patients were randomized to the control group. Eighteen patients crossed over from the FIB to the control group, and twelve crossed from the control to the FIB group. In the intent to treat analysis, demographic data, mechanism of injury, radiographic fracture classification, and surgical procedure were similar between the two groups. The FIB group consumed fewer MMEs prior to surgery (13 versus 17, p = 0.04), had a trend toward improved VAS on postop day (POD) 2 (0 versus 2 p = 0.06), and walked a farther distance POD 2 (25' versus 2 ' p = 0.09). A greater proportion of the FIB group was discharged home (50.9% versus 32.5%, p = 0.05). There were no differences in opioid-related, block-related, or medical complications between groups. In the as treated and per protocol analyses there were no significant differences.
CONCLUSIONS


A single perioperative FIB for patients with hip fractures undergoing surgery may decrease opioid consumption and increase the likelihood that a patient is discharged home.

697,32358782,Symptom Management Among Cancer Survivors: Randomized Pilot Intervention Trial of Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback.,"Chronic cancer-related symptoms (stress, fatigue, pain, depression, insomnia) may be linked with sympathetic nervous system over-activation and autonomic imbalance. Decreased heart rate variability (HRV) is an indicator of autonomic dysregulation that is commonly observed among cancer survivors. HRV biofeedback (HRVB) training induces HRV coherence, which maximizes HRV and facilitates autonomic and cardiorespiratory homeostasis. This randomized, wait-list-controlled, pilot intervention trial tested the hypothesis that HRVB can improve HRV coherence and alleviate cancer-related symptoms. The intervention group (n = 17) received 4-6 weekly HRVB training sessions until participants demonstrated skill acquisition. Controls (n = 17) received usual care. Outcomes assessed at baseline and follow-up included 15-min HRV recordings (HRV Coherence Ratio), and symptoms of: stress, distress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), pain, depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Linear mixed models for repeated measures were used to assess Group-by-Time interactions, pre- versus post-treatment differences in mean symptom scores, and group differences at follow-up. Mean HRV Coherence Ratios (± standard error) improved in the HRVB group at follow-up (baseline: 0.37 ± 0.05, post-intervention: 0.84 ± 0.18, p = 0.01), indicating intervention validity. Statistically significant Group-by-Time interactions indicated treatment-related improvements in HRV Coherence Ratios (p = 0.03, Pre-vs. post-treatment effect size [Cohen's d]: 0.98), sleep symptoms (p = 0.001, d = 1.19), and sleep-related daytime impairment (p = 0.005, d = 0.86). Relative to controls, the intervention group experienced trends toward improvements in stress, distress, fatigue, PTSD, and depression, although no other statistically significant Group-by-Time interactions were observed. This pilot intervention found that HRVB training reduced symptoms of sleep disturbance among cancer survivors. Larger-scale interventions are warranted to further evaluate the role of HRVB for managing symptoms in this population.

698,32358836,Cost-effectiveness evaluation of the PROPPR trial transfusion protocols.,"BACKGROUND


There have been no prior investigations of the cost effectiveness of transfusion strategies for trauma resuscitation. The Pragmatic, Randomized, Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios (PROPPR) study was a Phase III multisite, randomized trial in 680 subjects comparing the efficacy of 1:1:1 transfusion ratios of plasma and platelets to red blood cells with the 1:1:2 ratio. We hypothesized that 1:1:1 transfusion results in an acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, when estimated using patients' age-specific life expectancy and cost of care during the 30-day PROPPR trial period.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS


International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes were prospectively collected, and subjects were matched 1:2 to subjects in the Healthcare Utilization Program State Inpatient Data to estimate cost weights. We used a decision tree analysis, combined with standard costs and estimated years of expected survival to determine the cost effectiveness of the two treatments.
RESULTS


The 1:1:1 group had higher overall costs for the blood products but were more likely to achieve hemostasis and decreased hemorrhagic death by 24 hours (p = 0.006). For every 100 patients treated in the 1:1:1 group, eight more achieved hemostasis than in the 1:1:2 group. At 30 days, the total hospital cost per 100 patients was $5.6 million in the 1:1:1 group compared with $5.0 million in the 1:1:2 group. For each 100 patients, the 1:1:1 group had 218.5 more years of life expectancy. This was at a cost of $2994 per year gained.
CONCLUSION


The 1:1:1 transfusion ratio in severely injured hemorrhaging trauma patients is a very cost-effective strategy for increasing hemostasis and decreasing trauma deaths.",2020,The 1:1:1 group had higher overall costs for the blood products but were more likely to achieve hemostasis and decreased hemorrhagic death by 24 hours (p = 0.006).,"['severely injured hemorrhaging trauma patients', '680 subjects', 'International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes were prospectively collected, and subjects were matched 1:2 to subjects in the Healthcare Utilization Program State Inpatient Data to estimate cost weights']",[],"['hemostasis', 'overall costs', 'hemorrhagic death', 'total hospital cost', 'life expectancy']","[{'cui': 'C0205082', 'cui_str': 'Severe'}, {'cui': 'C0043251', 'cui_str': 'Injuries, Wounds'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0870733', 'cui_str': 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems'}, {'cui': 'C0205443', 'cui_str': 'Ninth'}, {'cui': 'C0439616', 'cui_str': 'Revisions'}, {'cui': 'C0009219', 'cui_str': 'Coding'}, {'cui': 'C0336766', 'cui_str': 'Matches'}, {'cui': 'C0086388', 'cui_str': 'Healthcare'}, {'cui': 'C0042153', 'cui_str': 'utilization'}, {'cui': 'C0018106', 'cui_str': 'Government Programs'}, {'cui': 'C1301808', 'cui_str': 'State'}, {'cui': 'C0021562', 'cui_str': 'Inpatient'}, {'cui': 'C0750572', 'cui_str': 'Estimated'}, {'cui': 'C0010186', 'cui_str': 'Cost'}, {'cui': 'C0005910', 'cui_str': 'Body weight'}]",[],"[{'cui': 'C0019116', 'cui_str': 'Hemostatic function'}, {'cui': 'C0282416', 'cui_str': 'Overall'}, {'cui': 'C0010186', 'cui_str': 'Cost'}, {'cui': 'C0333275', 'cui_str': 'Hemorrhagic'}, {'cui': 'C0011065', 'cui_str': 'Death'}, {'cui': 'C0439810', 'cui_str': 'Total'}, {'cui': 'C0206174', 'cui_str': 'Cost, Hospital'}, {'cui': 'C0023671', 'cui_str': 'Life Expectancy'}]",680.0,0.0809202,The 1:1:1 group had higher overall costs for the blood products but were more likely to achieve hemostasis and decreased hemorrhagic death by 24 hours (p = 0.006).,"[{'ForeName': 'Rachael A', 'Initials': 'RA', 'LastName': 'Callcut', 'Affiliation': 'Division of General Surgery, Department of Surgery, School of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kit N', 'Initials': 'KN', 'LastName': 'Simpson', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Healthcare Leadership & Management, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Sarah', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Baraniuk', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Erin E', 'Initials': 'EE', 'LastName': 'Fox', 'Affiliation': 'Center for Translational Injury Research and Department of Surgery, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Barbara C', 'Initials': 'BC', 'LastName': 'Tilley', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'John B', 'Initials': 'JB', 'LastName': 'Holcomb', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Acute Care Surgery, Department of Surgery, Center for Injury Science, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.'}, {'ForeName': '', 'Initials': '', 'LastName': '', 'Affiliation': ''}]",Transfusion,['10.1111/trf.15784']

700,32358874,A Comparison of the ARMEO to Tabletop Assisted Therapy Exercises as Supplemental Interventions in Acute Stroke Rehabilitation: A Randomized Single Blinded Study.,"OBJECTIVES


To evaluate the feasibility of an additional therapeutic upper limb exercise (ULE) intervention in early phase post-stroke rehabilitation and to assess outcomes of therapy using the Armeo Spring ® (ARMEO) VS. Therapist assisted Table Top (TAT) interventions.
DESIGN


Randomized, single-blinded trial.
SETTING


Stroke acute inpatient rehabilitation unit.
PARTICIPANTS


45 participants early after first stroke, Fugl Meyer Assessment (FMA) score > 8, Modified Ashworth score (MAS) of <3.
INTERVENTIONS


Participants were randomized to TAT or ARMEO ULE in addition to the required 3 hours of 1:1 standard of care provided in an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES


Completed number of treatments; withdrawals; serious/adverse events; Functional Independence Measure (FIM) Motor; FIM efficiency; FMA; MAS; elbow active (A) and passive (P) range of motion (ROM) and therapist effort measured by the Modified Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale (RPE).
RESULTS


Post-intervention FIM and FMA scores increased but did not demonstrate any statistically significant differences between the intervention groups (p = .585, .962, partial n 2  = .001, .001, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in post-intervention MAS elbow flexion and extension (p = .332, .252, partial n 2  = .009, .007, respectively) and A/P ROM elbow extension between training groups (p = .841, .731, partial n 2  = .001, .003, respectively). Post-intervention A/P ROM elbow flexion was statistically significantly different between groups (p = .031, .018, partial n 2  = .123, .146). Post-intervention RPE did not show any statistically significant differences between the training groups (p = .128, partial n 2  = .063). Total elbow range showed larger adjusted means gains for the ARMEO. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported.

701,32359046,Does Unit-Dose Packaging Influence Understanding of Serving Size Information for Cannabis Edibles?,"OBJECTIVE


Edible cannabis products have increased in popularity, particularly in jurisdictions that have legalized nonmedical cannabis. Rates of adverse events from cannabis edibles have also increased, in part because of difficulties identifying and titrating tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) levels. The current study tested whether packaging cannabis in separate units enhances consumer understanding of serving sizes.
METHOD


An experimental task was conducted as part of the 2018 International Cannabis Policy Study online survey. Participants were recruited from the Nielsen Global Insights Consumer Panel. A total of 26,894 participants (61.5% female) ages 16-65 years from Canada and the United States were randomly assigned to view a cannabis brownie packaged according to one of three conditions: (a) multiserving edible (""control condition""), (b) single-serving edible, and (c) single-serving edible packaged separately (""unit-dose packaging""). Participants were asked to identify a standard serving based on information on the product label. Logistic regression was used to test the influence of packaging condition on the likelihood of a correct response, adjusting for key covariates.
RESULTS


Compared with the multiserving edible control (50.6%), participants were significantly more likely to correctly identify the serving size in the single-serving edible condition (55.3%; adjusted odds ratio = 1.22, CI [1.15, 1.29], p < .001) and the unit-dose packaging condition (54.3%; adjusted odds ratio = 1.17, CI [1.10, 1.24], p < .001).
CONCLUSIONS


Packaging in which each product unit contained one dose of THC enhanced consumers' ability to identify how much of a product constitutes a standard serving or dose. Packaging products as individual doses eliminates the need for mental math and could reduce the risk of accidental overconsumption of cannabis.",2020,"Compared with the multiserving edible control (50.6%), participants were significantly more likely to correctly identify the serving size in the single-serving edible condition (55.3%; adjusted odds ratio = 1.22, CI [1.15, 1.29], p < .001) and the unit-dose packaging condition (54.3%; adjusted odds ratio = 1.17, CI [1.10, 1.24], p < .001).

702,32359068,Implementation intentions for weight loss in college students with overweight and obesity: a proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial.,"One in three college students have overweight or obesity and are in need of brief, simple weight loss interventions. Implementation intentions, a strategy that connects a goal-aligned behavior to a cue, facilitate goal attainment of health behaviors but have not been applied as a standalone treatment for weight loss. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of an implementation intention weight loss intervention in college students. In this three-arm, proof-of-concept, randomized controlled trial, college students with overweight/obesity (N = 95) were randomized to one of three conditions: an implementation intention group (IMP), an enhanced implementation intention group (IMP+) that included text message reminders and fluency training (i.e., training for speed and accuracy), and a control goal intention group (GOL) for 4 weeks. Participants completed anthropometric and self-report assessments pretreatment and posttreatment and experience-sampling assessments during the study to assess how implementation intentions contribute to behavior change. Across the sample, IMP and IMP+ groups reported significantly more goal-congruent behaviors than the GOL group. However, no between-condition differences emerged for weight and diet outcomes. Across conditions, students lost a statistically significant amount of weight, improved diet quality, and reduced caloric intake (ps < .05). Setting implementation intentions was associated with increased behaviors consistent with weight loss goals. Moreover, participants in all groups lost a statistically significant amount of weight. Incorporating implementation intentions into weight loss interventions, and testing the efficacy of this approach on weight loss over a longer duration, may be beneficial for college students with overweight/obesity.",2020,"Across conditions, students lost a statistically significant amount of weight, improved diet quality, and reduced caloric intake (ps < .05).","['college students with overweight/obesity (N = 95', 'college students with overweight/obesity', 'college students with overweight and obesity', 'college students']","['implementation intention weight loss intervention', 'implementation intention group (IMP), an enhanced implementation intention group (IMP+) that included text message reminders and fluency training (i.e., training for speed and accuracy), and a control goal intention group (GOL']","['weight', 'weight and diet outcomes', 'weight, improved diet quality, and reduced caloric intake', 'goal-congruent behaviors', 'weight loss', 'overweight or obesity']","[{'cui': 'C0557806', 'cui_str': 'College'}, {'cui': 'C0038492', 'cui_str': 'Student'}, {'cui': 'C0497406', 'cui_str': 'Overweight'}, {'cui': 'C0028754', 'cui_str': 'Obesity'}]","[{'cui': 'C0162425', 'cui_str': 'Intention'}, {'cui': 'C1262477', 'cui_str': 'Weight decreased'}, {'cui': 'C0184661', 'cui_str': 'Procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0439745', 'cui_str': 'Grouped'}, {'cui': 'C0332257', 'cui_str': 'Including'}, {'cui': 'C3178910', 'cui_str': 'Text Messages'}, {'cui': 'C0040607', 'cui_str': 'Training Programs'}, {'cui': 'C0336809', 'cui_str': 'Railway train'}, {'cui': 'C0025611', 'cui_str': 'Methamphetamine'}, {'cui': 'C0443131', 'cui_str': 'Accurate'}, {'cui': 'C0009932', 'cui_str': 'Control Groups'}, {'cui': 'C0018017', 'cui_str': 'Goal'}]","[{'cui': 'C0005910', 'cui_str': 'Body weight'}, {'cui': 'C0012155', 'cui_str': 'Dietary finding'}, {'cui': 'C1274040', 'cui_str': 'Result'}, {'cui': 'C0184511', 'cui_str': 'Improved'}, {'cui': 'C0332306', 'cui_str': 'Quality'}, {'cui': 'C0392756', 'cui_str': 'Reduced'}, {'cui': 'C0006777', 'cui_str': 'Energy intake'}, {'cui': 'C0018017', 'cui_str': 'Goal'}, {'cui': 'C0439853', 'cui_str': 'Congruent'}, {'cui': 'C0004927', 'cui_str': 'Behavior finding'}, {'cui': 'C1262477', 'cui_str': 'Weight decreased'}, {'cui': 'C0497406', 'cui_str': 'Overweight'}, {'cui': 'C0028754', 'cui_str': 'Obesity'}]",95.0,0.0387618,"Across conditions, students lost a statistically significant amount of weight, improved diet quality, and reduced caloric intake (ps < .05).","[{'ForeName': 'Jacqueline F', 'Initials': 'JF', 'LastName': 'Hayes', 'Affiliation': 'Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center, The Miriam Hospital, Providence, RI, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Katherine N', 'Initials': 'KN', 'LastName': 'Balantekin', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Andrea K', 'Initials': 'AK', 'LastName': 'Graham', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Medical Social Sciences and Preventive Medicine; Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Michael J', 'Initials': 'MJ', 'LastName': 'Strube', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Warren K', 'Initials': 'WK', 'LastName': 'Bickel', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Psychiatry, and Behavioral Medicine, Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine, Virginia Tech University, Roanoke, VA, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Denise E', 'Initials': 'DE', 'LastName': 'Wilfley', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.'}]",Translational behavioral medicine,['10.1093/tbm/ibaa038']
703,32359094,A Sex-Stratified Prognostic Nomogram Incorporating Body Compositions for Long-Term Mortality in Cirrhosis.,"BACKGROUND


Alterations in body compositions are related to poor outcomes and the presence of complications in cirrhosis. However, no predictive tools combining all these anthropometric parameters are applicable in the clinical setting. We aimed to clarify the potential utility of body compositions and develop a nomogram incorporating any independent factor for prognosticating long-term mortality in cirrhosis.
METHODS


A total of 414 patients were randomized into primary (n = 274) and validation (n = 140) cohorts. X-tile was performed to identify optimal cut points for stratifying participants. Multivariate Cox regression was performed, and nomogram incorporating body compositions were generated. The utility of developed models was evaluated by Harrell concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS


Stratifying by X-tilederived cut points, low skeletal muscle index (myopenia), high intramuscular adipose tissue content (myosteatosis), and the ratio of high visceral to subcutaneous adipose tissue area (adiposity) was independently associated with 3-year mortality. A sex-stratified nomogram incorporating anthropometric indices and clinical factors resulted in moderate discriminative accuracy, with a C-index of 0.787 (95% CI, 0.736-0.838) and 0.789 (95% CI, 0.727-0.851) in males and females, respectively. The calibration curve showed predictive survival corresponding optimally with the actual outcomes. Our models were feasible in the clinical settings based on DCA. Similar results were observed in the validation cohort. Additionally, participants could be classified into 3 distinct risk groups by the nomogram.
CONCLUSIONS


Our proposed nomogram embedding body compositions rendered an individualized predictive tool for long-term mortality in cirrhosis.",2020,"The utility of developed models was evaluated by Harrell concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA).

704,32359104,Long-term safety and efficacy of nalmefene in Japanese patients with alcohol dependence.,"AIM


The safety and efficacy of nalmefene in Japanese patients with high or very high World Health Organization drinking risk level of alcohol dependence has been assessed in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 (lead-in) study; here the long-term safety and efficacy of nalmefene in an open-label extension of the lead-in study are presented.
METHODS


Patients who completed the 24-week lead-in study were eligible for the extension study, where they were treated with nalmefene 20 mg as needed for 24 weeks. The long-term safety and efficacy of nalmefene 20 mg during the total 48-week period were evaluated. Treatment-emergent adverse events during the study period were recorded and change from baseline in the number of heavy drinking days and total alcohol consumption were calculated.
RESULTS


Overall, long-term nalmefene 20 mg was well tolerated; the main treatment-emergent adverse events reported in ≥5% of patients included nasopharyngitis (37.2%), nausea (36.5%), somnolence (21.2%), dizziness (16.8%), malaise (14.6%), and vomiting (12.4%). The number of heavy drinking days and total alcohol consumption decreased from baseline to 48 weeks (mixed model for repeated measures, least squares mean ± standard error, -15.09 ± 0.77 days/month and -53.20 ± 2.29 g/day, respectively) during the study.
CONCLUSION


This long-term evaluation in Japanese patients with a high or very high drinking risk levels of alcohol dependence indicated that nalmefene was safe, well tolerated, and efficacious.

705,30935865,Male partners of subfertile couples in which the spouse is obese display adverse weight and lifestyle associated with reduced sperm quality.,"OBJECTIVES


To assess: 1-the spousal concordance of lifestyle and anthropometric characteristics between partners of infertile couples in which the woman is obese; and 2-in men, the influence of these characteristics on their conventional seminal parameters.
DESIGN


Cross-sectional study.
SETTING


Fertility clinic of the Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke, Canada, between January 2012 and February 2015.
PATIENTS


97 infertile heterosexual couples in which women were obese and seeking fertility treatments.
INTERVENTION


Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES


Weight and percentage of fat mass were evaluated using a scale with foot-to-foot bio-impedance. Abdominal obesity was estimated with waist circumference and lifestyle habits, by a self-reported questionnaire. Seminal parameters were analysed and collected according to the WHO guidelines (Kruger's strict criteria for seminal morphology).
RESULTS


There was a significant spousal concordance for the percentage of fat mass, leisure activities and overall nutritional quality. Accordingly, male participants displayed anthropometric and lifestyle characteristics at higher risk than Canadian men of similar age. Moreover, BMI, daily consumption of fruits & vegetables and sleeping hours in men were independently associated to the total motile sperm count.
CONCLUSION


This is the first study to report concordance for anthropometric and lifestyle characteristics between partners of infertile couples in which the woman is obese. These characteristics in men were more adverse than in the general population and were associated with reduced sperm quality. Altogether, our results suggest that male partners of infertile couples could benefit from participating in the lifestyle intervention that is already recommended for their spouse affected by obesity.
CAPSULE


Because partners of subfertile couples in which the woman is obese share adverse anthropometric and lifestyle characteristics, male partners should be implicated in lifestyle interventions already indicated for their spouse.",2019,"There was a significant spousal concordance for the percentage of fat mass, leisure activities and overall nutritional quality.","['Male partners of subfertile couples', 'Fertility clinic of the Centre hospitalier universitaire de Sherbrooke, Canada, between January 2012 and February 2015', 'partners of infertile couples in which the woman is obese;

706,30946709,Philadelphia Telemedicine Glaucoma Detection and Follow-up Study: Intraocular Pressure Measurements Found in a Population at High Risk for Glaucoma.,"PRECIS


Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements, when used during telemedicine eye screening alongside nonmydriatic fundus photography, were shown to improve the likelihood of accurate glaucoma and glaucoma-related diagnoses at the follow-up eye examination.
PURPOSE


To determine if IOP measurements, used as an adjunct to nonmydriatic fundus photography, are useful in glaucoma telemedicine screening.
MATERIALS AND METHODS


A total of 902 high-risk individuals were screened for glaucoma at 7 primary care practices and 4 Federally Qualified Health Centers using telemedicine. Screening at visit 1 included fundus photography, assessing family history of glaucoma, and IOP measurements using a hand-held rebound tonometer. Participants with suspicious nerve findings for glaucoma, IOP>21 mm Hg or other ocular pathologies were invited for a follow-up appointment with an ophthalmologist (visit 2).
RESULTS


Of the 902 individuals screened at visit 1, 19.6% (n=177/902) had elevated IOP (>21 mm Hg). Fifteen participants were found to have an IOP>30 mm Hg at visit 1, including 2 with an IOP of >40 mm Hg. Among all who attended visit 2 (n=347), 10.9% had glaucoma and 7.2% had ocular hypertension. For participants having both suspicious nerve findings and IOP>21 mm Hg compared with those with neither, the odds ratio (OR) of being diagnosed with glaucoma was 4.48 (95% CI, 1.50-13.93; P=0.007), whereas for participants with suspicious discs and IOP≤21 mm Hg the OR was 2.04 (95% CI, 0.83-5.53; P=0.15).
CONCLUSIONS


In this telemedicine vision screening setting, having a higher IOP at the screening visit increased the likelihood of receiving a final diagnosis of glaucoma. Therefore, this study supports incorporating IOP measurements, using a portable tonometer, into vision screening programs in high-risk populations.",2019,"RESULTS

707,32357088,"Are Low-Income, Diverse Mothers Able to Meet Breastfeeding Intentions After 2 Months of Breastfeeding?","Background:  Little is known about intended breastfeeding duration of women who initiate breastfeeding. We describe the association between intended and actual breastfeeding duration among low-income, diverse mothers who report maintaining breastfeeding for the first 2 months postpartum.  Materials and Methods:  We included mothers (64% Hispanic, 17% non-Hispanic black) participating in Greenlight, a cluster randomized childhood obesity prevention trial, who were providing breast milk at the 2-month preventive service visit and reported intended breastfeeding duration at this visit. Breastfeeding status was assessed at subsequent visits, up to 24 months. Poisson regression with a robust variance estimator was used to estimate risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals for meeting breastfeeding intentions. Covariates included race/ethnicity, income, receiving benefits from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), education, age, employment, depression, maternal obesity, U.S. born, whether infant was first born, and study site.  Results:  Median intended breastfeeding duration was 11.5 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 6-12) and median actual breastfeeding duration was 8.6 months (IQR: 4-14) ( n  = 349). Approximately half (49%) met intended breastfeeding duration. Breastfeeding duration differed based on milk type provided at the 2-month visit in that mothers providing mostly or only breast milk had increased likelihood of meeting breastfeeding intentions. Regardless of milk type provided at 2 months, the longer a mother intended to breastfeed, the less likely she was to meet her breastfeeding intentions.

Epistaxis is the most frequent and life-threatening manifestation and tacrolimus, an immunosuppressive agent, appears to be an interesting new treatment option because of its anti-angiogenic properties. Our objective was to evaluate, six weeks after the end of the treatment, the efficacy on the duration of nosebleeds of tacrolimus nasal ointment, administered for six weeks to patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia complicated by nosebleeds, and we performed a prospective, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, ratio 1:1 phase II study. Patients were recruited from three French Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) centers between May 2017 and August 2018, with a six-week follow-up, and we included people aged over 18 years, diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and epistaxis (total duration > 30 min/6 weeks prior to inclusion). Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% was self-administered by the patients twice daily. About 0.1 g of product was to be administered in each nostril with a cotton swab. A total of 50 patients was randomized and treated. Mean epistaxis duration before and after treatment in the tacrolimus group were 324.64 and 249.14 min, respectively, and in the placebo group 224.69 and 188.14 min, respectively. Epistaxis duration improved in both groups, with no significant difference in our main objective comparing epistaxis before and after treatment ( p =  0.77); however, there was a significant difference in evolution when comparing epistaxis before and during treatment ( p =  0.04). Toxicity was low and no severe adverse events were reported. In conclusion, tacrolimus nasal ointment, administered for six weeks, did not improve epistaxis in HHT patients after the end of the treatment.

710,32357579,Are Vitamin D 3  Tablets and Oil Drops Equally Effective in Raising S-25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentrations? A Post-Hoc Analysis of an Observational Study on Immunodeficient Patients.,"BACKGROUND


Vitamin D 3  supplements are available as tablets or oil drops, but there is no consensus as to whether either of these preparations is more effective than the other.
METHODS


We compared the effectiveness of tablets versus oil in raising S-25-hydroxyvitamin D (S-25-OHD) in plasma by re-analyzing data from a previously performed observational study in which immunodeficient patients with S-25-OHD concentrations <75 nmol/L were randomly prescribed vitamin D 3  tablets (1600 IU/day) or vitamin D 3  oil-drops (1500 IU/day) for twelve months. Tablets and oil were compared for the effect on S-25-OHD concentrations after 3-5 months and antibiotic use.
RESULTS


Data on S-25-OHD after ≥ 3 months was available for 137 patients treated with tablets and 69 with oil drops. Both groups exhibited a significant increase in S-25-OHD-oil-drops from 55 to 86 nmol/L and tablets from 52 to 87 nmol/L-with no difference between groups ( p  = 0.77). In a subgroup of patients without immunoglobulin replacement, vitamin D 3  supplementation with oil drops ( n  = 34) but not with tablets ( n  = 60) resulted in significantly lower antibiotic administration ( p  < 0.001 and  p  = 0.58).
CONCLUSION


Vitamin D 3  supplementation with tablets and oil drops were equally efficient in raising S-25-OHD concentrations. Only oil drops caused a reduction in antibiotic consumption in immuno-deficient patients who did not receive immunoglobulin replacement.",2020,Both groups exhibited a significant increase in S-25-OHD-oil-drops from 55 to 86 nmol/L and tablets from 52 to 87 nmol/L-with no difference between groups ( p  = 0.77).,"['Immunodeficient Patients', 'immunodeficient patients with S-25-OHD concentrations <75 nmol', '137 patients treated with tablets and 69 with oil drops']","['vitamin D 3  supplementation with oil drops', 'Vitamin D 3  supplementation with tablets and oil drops', 'vitamin D 3  tablets', 'vitamin D 3  oil-drops']","['antibiotic administration', 'S-25-OHD concentrations', 'S-25-OHD-oil-drops', 'raising S-25-OHD concentrations', 'antibiotic consumption']","[{'cui': 'C0021051', 'cui_str': 'Immunodeficiency disorder'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C1859049', 'cui_str': 'Haddad syndrome'}, {'cui': 'C0004268', 'cui_str': 'Attention'}, {'cui': 'C0439191', 'cui_str': 'nmol'}, {'cui': 'C4517569', 'cui_str': '137'}, {'cui': 'C0332293', 'cui_str': 'Treated with'}, {'cui': 'C0039225', 'cui_str': 'Tablet'}, {'cui': 'C0028908', 'cui_str': 'Oil'}, {'cui': 'C1321095', 'cui_str': 'Drop - unit of product usage'}]","[{'cui': 'C0008318', 'cui_str': 'Cholecalciferol'}, {'cui': 'C0242297', 'cui_str': 'Nutritional supplementation'}, {'cui': 'C0028908', 'cui_str': 'Oil'}, {'cui': 'C1321095', 'cui_str': 'Drop - unit of product usage'}, {'cui': 'C0039225', 'cui_str': 'Tablet'}]","[{'cui': 'C0199779', 'cui_str': 'Administration of antibiotic'}, {'cui': 'C1859049', 'cui_str': 'Haddad syndrome'}, {'cui': 'C0004268', 'cui_str': 'Attention'}, {'cui': 'C0028908', 'cui_str': 'Oil'}, {'cui': 'C1321095', 'cui_str': 'Drop - unit of product usage'}, {'cui': 'C0442818', 'cui_str': 'Raised'}, {'cui': 'C0003232', 'cui_str': 'Antibiotic'}, {'cui': 'C0009830', 'cui_str': 'Consumption'}]",,0.306117,Both groups exhibited a significant increase in S-25-OHD-oil-drops from 55 to 86 nmol/L and tablets from 52 to 87 nmol/L-with no difference between groups ( p  = 0.77).,"[{'ForeName': 'Maria', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Helde Frankling', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society (NVS), Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Blickagången 16, Neo floor 7, SE-141 83 Huddinge, Sweden.'}, {'ForeName': 'Anna-Carin', 'Initials': 'AC', 'LastName': 'Norlin', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, The Immunodeficiency Unit, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, SE-141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'ForeName': 'Susanne', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Hansen', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, The Immunodeficiency Unit, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, SE-141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'ForeName': 'Emilie', 'Initials': 'E', 'LastName': 'Wahren Borgström', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, The Immunodeficiency Unit, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, SE-141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'ForeName': 'Peter', 'Initials': 'P', 'LastName': 'Bergman', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, The Immunodeficiency Unit, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, SE-141 86 Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'ForeName': 'Linda', 'Initials': 'L', 'LastName': 'Björkhem-Bergman', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society (NVS), Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Blickagången 16, Neo floor 7, SE-141 83 Huddinge, Sweden.'}]",Nutrients,['10.3390/nu12051230']
711,32357807,Out of pocket expenses in obsessive compulsive disorder.,"Background:  Despite anecdotal evidence that the out of pocket costs of OCD can be substantial in some cases, there is no evidence on how many people they affect, or the magnitude of these costs. Aims:  This paper explores the type and quantity of out of pocket expenses reported by a large sample of adults with OCD. Methods:  Data on out of pocket expenses were collected from participants taking part in the OCTET multi-centre randomised controlled trial. Participants were aged 18+, meeting DSM-IV criteria for OCD, and scoring 16+ on the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. Individual-level resource use data including a description and estimated cost of out of pocket expenses were measured using an adapted version of the Adult Service Use Schedule (AD-SUS): a questionnaire used to collect data on resource use. Results:  Forty-five percent (208/465) reported out of pocket expenses due to their OCD. The mean cost of out of pocket expenses was £19.19 per week (SD £27.56 SD), range £0.06-£224.00.

712,32357854,Comparison of power-free-chop and phaco-chop techniques for moderate nuclei.,"BACKGROUND


To compare the intraoperative and postoperative effects of power-free-chop and phaco-chop techniques for moderate nuclei in phacoemulsification surgery.
METHODS


Sixty patients were evaluated in 2 groups. The power-free-chop technique was performed in Group 1 (30 eyes), and the phaco-chop technique was performed in Group 2 (30 eyes). There were no significant differences between these 2 groups. The cumulative dissipated energy (CDE), time to achieve maximum vision, corneal thickness variation, and time to return to the preoperative values were collected. All parameters were statistically compared in these 2 groups by using the chi-square test and the independent-sample t-test.
RESULTS


The CDE was 5.53 ± 1.92 J in Group 1 and 7.02 ± 1.77 J in Group 2. After the operation, the mean time to recover to the maximum vision was 2.80 ± 1.42 days in Group 1 and 3.80 ± 1.92 days in Group 2. The mean postoperative corneal thickness increased 36.9 ± 14.74 μm in Group 1 and 46.20 ± 20.67 μm in Group 2. The mean time to return to preoperative pachymetry values was 3.73 ± 1.70 days and 4.83 ± 2.11 days in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. There were significant differences in these parameters between the groups.

713,32357869,Identifying facilitators and barriers for adolescents participating in a school-based HIIT intervention: the eXercise for asthma with commando Joe's® (X4ACJ) programme.,"BACKGROUND


High-intensity interval training (HIIT) elicits numerous health benefits, but little evidence is available regarding the feasibility of delivering school-based HIIT interventions. The aim of this study was to explore adolescents' perceptions of a 6-month, 3 × 30-min sessions per week, HIIT intervention delivered either before or after school.
METHOD


Eighty adolescents allocated to the intervention group (13.3 ± 1.0 years; 45 boys) were invited to take part in semi-structured focus groups post-intervention. Participants were categorised as attendees (≥40% attendance) or non-attendees (< 5% attendance). Data were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed deductively, with key emergent themes represented using pen profiles.
RESULTS


Results showed that a school-based HIIT intervention can be an enjoyable form of exercise. Irrespective of attendance, similar facilitators and barriers to participating were highlighted, including benefits of participation, content of the exercise session and the intervention instructor.
CONCLUSION


This study provides support for the delivery of a HIIT intervention in a school setting but highlights the importance of a flexible design and delivery to accommodate competing interests. There is a need to educate adolescents on the possible benefits of participation and to make the sessions enjoyable in order to increase their extrinsic and intrinsic motivation to sustain participation.",2020,Participants were categorised as attendees (≥40% attendance) or non-attendees (< 5% attendance).,"['Eighty adolescents allocated to the intervention group (13.3\u2009±\u20091.0\u2009years; 45 boys', ""adolescents participating in a school-based HIIT intervention: the eXercise for asthma with commando Joe's® (X4ACJ) programme"", 'Participants were categorised as attendees (≥40% attendance) or non-attendees (<\u20095% attendance']","['HIIT intervention', 'High-intensity interval training (HIIT']",[],"[{'cui': 'C3816958', 'cui_str': '80'}, {'cui': 'C0205653', 'cui_str': 'Adolescent'}, {'cui': 'C0184661', 'cui_str': 'Procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0439745', 'cui_str': 'Grouped'}, {'cui': 'C0439234', 'cui_str': 'year'}, {'cui': 'C0870221', 'cui_str': 'Male child'}, {'cui': 'C0036375', 'cui_str': 'School'}, {'cui': 'C0002055', 'cui_str': 'Alkali'}, {'cui': 'C4277545', 'cui_str': 'High-intensity interval training'}, {'cui': 'C0015259', 'cui_str': 'Exercise'}, {'cui': 'C0004096', 'cui_str': 'Asthma'}, {'cui': 'C0237484', 'cui_str': 'School attendance'}]","[{'cui': 'C4277545', 'cui_str': 'High-intensity interval training'}, {'cui': 'C0184661', 'cui_str': 'Procedure'}]",[],,0.0325206,Participants were categorised as attendees (≥40% attendance) or non-attendees (< 5% attendance).,"[{'ForeName': 'Catherine A', 'Initials': 'CA', 'LastName': 'Sharp', 'Affiliation': 'Public Health Collaborating Unit, School of Health Sciences, Bangor University, Bangor, UK.'}, {'ForeName': 'Melitta A', 'Initials': 'MA', 'LastName': 'McNarry', 'Affiliation': 'Applied Sports Science Technology, Exercise and Medicine (A-STEM) Research Centre, College of Engineering, Bay Campus, Swansea University, Swansea, UK. m.mcnarry@swansea.ac.uk.'}, {'ForeName': 'William T B', 'Initials': 'WTB', 'LastName': 'Eddolls', 'Affiliation': 'Applied Sports Science Technology, Exercise and Medicine (A-STEM) Research Centre, College of Engineering, Bay Campus, Swansea University, Swansea, UK.'}, {'ForeName': 'Harriet', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Koorts', 'Affiliation': 'Institute for Physical Activity and Nutrition (IPAN), School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences, Deakin University, Geelong, Australia.'}, {'ForeName': 'Charles O N', 'Initials': 'CON', 'LastName': 'Winn', 'Affiliation': 'Applied Sports Science Technology, Exercise and Medicine (A-STEM) Research Centre, College of Engineering, Bay Campus, Swansea University, Swansea, UK.'}, {'ForeName': 'Kelly A', 'Initials': 'KA', 'LastName': 'Mackintosh', 'Affiliation': 'Applied Sports Science Technology, Exercise and Medicine (A-STEM) Research Centre, College of Engineering, Bay Campus, Swansea University, Swansea, UK.'}]",BMC public health,['10.1186/s12889-020-08740-3']
714,32357889,The effect of antimicrobial activity of Teucrium Polium on Oral Streptococcus Mutans: a randomized cross-over clinical trial study.,"BACKGROUND


The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a mouthwash containing Teucriumpolium herb on Streptococcus mutans in mouth.
METHODS


This study was a randomized, crossover, double-blind clinical trial, where we selected 22 volunteers (dental students) randomly and we divided them into two groups. The study had two phases. In each phase, one group acted as the intervention group, while the other one was the control group. Both the intervention and control groups were given the mouthwash with and without Teucriumpolium, respectively. S. mutans of saliva were measured before and after each phase to compare the effects of the mouthwashes. A three-week washout period was considered between the two phases. An independent two-sample t-test was utilized to compare the mean of S. mutans colonies. Additionally, we used a standard AB/BA crossover model to find the results of the treatment and the impact of carryover on the residual's biological effects. The significance level was considered 0.05 in this experiment.
RESULTS


There is no significant difference observed between the two groups in the number of S. mutans before using the mouthwashes. When the mouthwash containing Teucriumpolium was used, there was a significant decrease in the number of S. mutans colonies in both phases' extract (P = 0.002).
CONCLUSION


The results of this study indicate the mouthwash containing aqueous extract of Teucrium polium can majorly reduce the colonization of S. mutans in human saliva.

715,32357897,Randomized control trial comparing an Alvarado Score-based management algorithm and current best practice in the evaluation of suspected appendicitis.,"BACKGROUND


An objective algorithm for the management of suspected appendicitis guided by the Alvarado Score had previously been proposed. This algorithm was expected to reduce computed tomography (CT) utilization without compromising the negative appendectomy rate. This study attempts to validate the proposed algorithm in a randomized control trial.
METHODS


A randomized control trial comparing the management of suspected acute appendicitis using the proposed algorithm compared to current best practice, with the rate of CT utilization as the primary outcome of interest. Secondary outcomes included the percentage of missed diagnosis, negative appendectomies, length of stay in days, and overall cost of stay in dollars.
RESULTS


One hundred sixty patients were randomized. Characteristics such as age, ethnic group, American Society of Anesthesiologist score, white cell count, and symptom duration were similar between the two groups. The overall CT utilization rate of the intervention arm and the usual care arm were similar (93.7% vs 92.5%, p = 0.999). There were no differences in terms of negative appendectomy rate, length of stay, and cost of stay between the intervention arm as compared to the usual care arm (p = 0.926, p = 0.705, and p = 0.886, respectively). Among patients evaluated with CT, 75% (112 out of 149) revealed diagnoses for the presenting symptoms.
CONCLUSION


The proposed AS-based management algorithm did not reduce the CT utilization rate. Outcomes such as missed diagnoses, negative appendectomy rates, length of stay, and cost of stay were also largely similar. CT utilization was prevalent as 93% of the study cohort was evaluated by CT scan.

716,32357926,"Design of a randomized controlled trial of a partnership-based, needs-tailored self-management support intervention for post-treatment breast cancer survivors.","BACKGROUND


Self-management is becoming essential for breast cancer survivors, but evidence about the effectiveness of self-management support (SMS) intervention is lacking. To address this issue, we developed a theory-based SMS intervention, the 'EMPOWER', aimed at empowering breast cancer survivors. Here we describe the rationale of the intervention and its development.
METHODS


The conceptual framework of this study is the Chronic Care Model, which posits that SMS can influence patient-provider relationships and ultimately improve health outcomes. We will conduct a multi-center, 2-armed randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of EMPOWER among post-treatment breast cancer survivors in South Korea. The trial will include 94 women who completed primary breast cancer treatment within the last 6 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention group or the wait-list control group (1:1). The intervention group will receive a 7-week partnership-based and needs-tailored SMS intervention via telephone counseling. The primary outcome is empowerment. The secondary outcomes include self-efficacy for post-treatment self-management behaviors, mental adjustment, psychological distress, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Data will be collected by self-reported questionnaire at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up.
DISCUSSION


We believe that the EMPOWER intervention could improve HRQOL of post-treatment breast cancer survivors by enhancing their empowerment. If found successful, it could aid clinicians engaged in the long-term care of breast cancer survivors.

717,32357940,Dosing parameters for the effects of high-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation on smoking cessation: study protocol for a randomized factorial sham-controlled clinical trial.,"BACKGROUND


Despite the considerable success of comprehensive tobacco control efforts, tobacco use remains one of the greatest preventable causes of death and disease today. Over half of all smokers in the US make quit attempts every year, but over 90% relapse within 12 months, choosing the immediate reinforcement of smoking over the long-term benefits of quitting. Conceptual and empirical evidence supports continued investigation of high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in reducing relapse and decreasing cigarette consumption. While this evidence is compelling, an optimal dosing strategy must be determined before a long-term efficacy trial can be conducted. The goal of this study is to determine a dosing strategy for 20 Hz rTMS that will produce the best long-term abstinence outcomes with the fewest undesirable effects.
METHODS


This is a fully crossed, double-blinded, sham-controlled, 3x2x2 randomized factorial study. The three factors are duration (stimulation days: 8, 12, and 16); intensity (900 or 1800 pulses per day); and sham control. Participants (n = 258) will consist of adults (18-65) who are motivated to quit smoking cigarettes and who will be followed for 6 months post-quit. Outcomes include latency to relapse, point prevalence abstinence rates, delay discounting rates, cognitive-behavioral skills acquisition, and multiple measures of potential undesirable effects that impact participant compliance.
DISCUSSION


This study integrates existing theoretical concepts and methodologies from neuropsychology, behavioral economics, brain stimulation, clinical psychology, and the evidence-based treatment of tobacco dependence in the development of a promising and innovative approach to treat tobacco dependence. This study will establish an optimal dosing regimen for efficacy testing. Findings are expected to have a significant influence on advancing this approach as well as informing future research on clinical approaches that combine rTMS with other evidence-based treatments for tobacco dependence and perhaps other addictions.

718,32357944,Protocol for the trial to establish a causal linkage between mycotoxin exposure and child stunting: a cluster randomized trial.,"BACKGROUND


The number of stunted children has fallen globally but continues to increase in Africa. Stunting is estimated to contribute to 14-17% of child deaths under 5 years of age and is a risk factor for poor cognitive and motor development and educational outcomes. Inadequate dietary intake and disease are thought to be the immediate causes of undernutrition and stunting. However, improving infant diets through complementary feeding interventions has been shown to only modestly reduce stunting. Multiple observational studies demonstrate a dose response relationship between fetal and post-natal aflatoxin exposure and reduced linear growth.
METHODS


This community-based cluster randomized trial will measure the effect of a reduced aflatoxin diet on length-for-age Z scores at 18 months in central Tanzania. All 52 health facilities in the Kongwa District of Dodoma Region were randomized into two groups. Starting at 6 months of age, participants in the intervention group receive a low-aflatoxin pre-blended porridge flour containing maize and groundnut (ratio 4:1 respectively) and low-aflatoxin groundnut flour, whereas in the control group the same porridge mix and groundnut flour are promoted through education but acquired by the household. Both groups will receive the same infant and young child feeding education and a thermos flask. A total of 3120 infants between 6 weeks and 3 months of age will be recruited into the study over 1 year. Data will be collected four times - at recruitment and when the infants are 6, 12 and 18 months of age. In a cohort of 600 infants, additional data will be collected at 9 and 15 months of age. The primary outcome is length-for-age at 18 months. Secondary outcomes include the Z scores for weight-for-age, middle upper arm circumference and head circumference, and the blood biomarker aflatoxin-albumin in the full sample, with the urine biomarker aflatoxin M1 analyzed in the cohort only.
DISCUSSION


Better understanding the etiology of childhood stunting can lead to more appropriate interventions and policies to further reduce linear growth faltering and meet the Sustainable Development Goals.

Methods:  With institutional review board approval and informed consent, patients were randomly divided into three groups: Group A ( n  = 10) were treated with 1.18 ± 0.09 GBq/dose of  177 Lu-EB-PSMA. Group B ( n  = 10) were treated with 2.12 ± 0.19 GBq/dose of  177 Lu-EB-PSMA. Group C ( n  = 8) were treated with 3.52 ± 0.58 GBq/dose of  177 Lu-EB-PSMA. Eligible patients received up to three cycles of  177 Lu-EB-PSMA therapy, at eight-week intervals.  Results:  Due to disease progression or bone marrow suppression, 4 out of 10, 5 out of 10, and 5 out of 10 patients completed three cycles therapy as planned in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was correlated with treatment dose, with PSA disease control rates in Group B (70%) and C (75%) being higher than that in Group A (10%) ( P  = 0.007), but no correlation between Group B and Group C was found.  68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT showed response in all the treatment groups, however, there was no significant difference between the three groups. Hematologic toxicity study found that platelets in Group B and Group C decreased more than those in Group A, and that Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 2 (25.0%) patients in Group C. No serious nephritic or hepatic side effects were observed.  Conclusion:  This study demonstrates that 2.12 GBq/dose of  177 Lu-EB-PSMA seems to be safe and adequate in tumor treatment.

721,31437669,Inguinal microbiome in patients undergoing an endovascular aneurysm repair: Application of next-generation sequencing of the 16S-23S rRNA regions.,"BACKGROUND


Surgical site infection (SSI) remains a hazardous complication after vascular surgery. In this pilot study we investigated the inguinal microbiome in skin biopsies using histology and 16S-23S rDNA Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Our hypothesis was that causative microorganisms of SSI are present in the inguinal microbiome.
METHODS


Data on surgical site infections and skin samples from the Percutaneous in Endovascular Repair versus Open (PiERO) trail were evaluated. Two patients with SSI were matched for age and comorbidity to eight matching patients of the PiERO trial. All patients were treated for an abdominal aortic aneurysm with endovascular repair. Nasal and perineal cultures were taken preoperatively to detect Staphylococcus aureus carriage. After disinfection with chlorhexidine, groin biopsies were taken to identify bacteria in deeper skin layers. All samples were subjected to histological analysis and culture-free 16S-23S rDNA NGS.
RESULTS


Staphylococcus aureus species were cultured in 5 out of 20 preoperative nasal and perineal swaps. Histology detected only a few bacteria. NGS of the 16S-23S rRNA regions identified DNA of bacterial species in all biopsies (20/20). Most identified genera and species proved to be known skin flora bacteria. No relation was found between SSIs and the preoperative microbiome.
CONCLUSION


In this pilot study, an innovative analysis of the preoperative microbiome using 16S-23S rDNA NGS did not show a relation with the occurrence of a surgical site infection.

Bone-filling mesh container (BFMC) can significantly relieve pain, help the correction of kyphosis, and may prevent cement leakage. This pilot study may provide the basis for the design of future studies.
PURPOSE


To compare the effectiveness and safety of BFMC and percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) for treatment of Kümmell's disease.
METHODS


From August 2016 to May 2018, 40 patients with Kümmell's disease were admitted to Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital. Among them, 20 patients (20 vertebral bodies) received PKP (PKP group) and the other 20 received BFMC (BFMC group). Operation time, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Cobb's angle changes, and related complications were recorded.
RESULTS


All patients underwent operations successfully. VAS scores and ODI of both groups at each postoperative time point were lower than preoperatively, with statistically significant difference (p < 0.05). Postoperative Cobb's angle of both groups postoperatively was lower than preoperatively (p < 0.05). Cement leakage occurred in eight vertebrae (8/20) in the PKP group and in one vertebra (1/20) in the BFMC group. No complications such as pulmonary embolism, paraplegia, or perioperative death occurred during operation in both groups. Adjacent vertebral refractures occurred in five patients (5/20) in the PKP group and in four patients (4/20) in the BFMC group, with no significant difference in the incidence rate of refractures in both groups but the material is too small to verify statistically.
CONCLUSIONS

724,31768768,Effect of unfocused extracorporeal shockwave therapy on bone mineral content of twelve distal forearms of postmenopausal women: a clinical pilot study.,"Extracorporeal shockwave therapy showed a pronounced effect on bone mass in previous animal studies. We showed in this pilot study that a single treatment with unfocused shockwave therapy in unselected patients does not show side effects. Although our study did not show any effect of shockwave on BMD, the limited sample size does not definitively exclude this and a study with 174 subjects per group would be needed to show an effect size of 0.3 with a power of 80%.
PURPOSE


Unfocused extracorporeal shockwave therapy might stimulate bone formation to reduce the fracture risk. In this study, we assessed the safety of unfocused extracorporeal shockwave therapy and its effects on bone mass.
METHODS


A clinical pilot study with twelve female patients free of bone disease undergoing elective surgery of the lower extremity or elective spinal surgery under general anesthesia received 3.000 electrohydraulic-generated unfocused extracorporeal shockwaves (energy flux density 0.3 mJ/mm 2 ) to one distal forearm. The contralateral forearm served as a control. We examined the effect on bone mass with the use of repeated dual energy X-ray absorptiometry measurements and we measured patient discomfort around the therapy.
RESULTS


No difference in bone mineral content and density was measured 6 and 12 weeks after therapy. shockwave therapy occasionally caused transient erythema or mild hematoma, but no discomfort in daily life or (late) adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS


Unfocused extracorporeal shockwave therapy is a safe treatment, but no increase in bone mass on the forearm was found at 0.3 mJ/mm 2  energy flux density. In this study, we were not able to demonstrate that a single treatment with unfocused shockwave therapy in unselected patients had any effect in terms of bone mineral density (BMD) or bone mineral content (BMC). A power analysis indicated that 174 patients per group are required to show an effect size of 0.3 with a power of 80%.",2019,"Unfocused extracorporeal shockwave therapy is a safe treatment, but no increase in bone mass on the forearm was found at 0.3 mJ/mm 2  energy flux density.","['174 subjects per group', 'twelve female patients free of bone disease undergoing elective surgery of the lower extremity or elective spinal surgery under general anesthesia received 3.000', 'unselected patients', 'twelve distal forearms of postmenopausal women']","['Extracorporeal shockwave therapy', 'shockwave therapy', 'electrohydraulic-generated unfocused extracorporeal shockwaves ', 'extracorporeal shockwave therapy']","['transient erythema or mild hematoma', 'bone mineral content and density', 'bone mass', 'bone mineral density (BMD) or bone mineral content (BMC', 'bone mineral content', 'discomfort in daily life or (late) adverse events']","[{'cui': 'C4517604', 'cui_str': '174'}, {'cui': 'C0439745', 'cui_str': 'Grouped'}, {'cui': 'C0043210', 'cui_str': 'Woman'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0332296', 'cui_str': 'Free of'}, {'cui': 'C0005940', 'cui_str': 'Disorder of bone'}, {'cui': 'C0206058', 'cui_str': 'Optional surgery'}, {'cui': 'C0023216', 'cui_str': 'Lower limb structure'}, {'cui': 'C0038895', 'cui_str': 'operative procedures'}, {'cui': 'C1719976', 'cui_str': 'Under general anesthesia'}, {'cui': 'C0205108', 'cui_str': 'Distal'}, {'cui': 'C0016536', 'cui_str': 'Forearm structure'}, {'cui': 'C0232970', 'cui_str': 'Postmenopausal state'}]","[{'cui': 'C1737238', 'cui_str': 'Extracorporeal shock wave therapy'}, {'cui': 'C0013216', 'cui_str': 'Drug therapy'}, {'cui': 'C0442829', 'cui_str': 'Electrohydraulic'}, {'cui': 'C0442087', 'cui_str': 'Extracorporeal'}]","[{'cui': 'C0040704', 'cui_str': 'Transients'}, {'cui': 'C0041834', 'cui_str': 'Erythema'}, {'cui': 'C1513302', 'cui_str': 'Common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 1'}, {'cui': 'C0018944', 'cui_str': 'Hematoma'}, {'cui': 'C0005963', 'cui_str': 'Bone Mineral Content'}, {'cui': 'C0178587', 'cui_str': 'Density'}, {'cui': 'C0005938', 'cui_str': 'Bone Mineral Density'}, {'cui': 'C2364135', 'cui_str': 'Discomfort'}, {'cui': 'C0332173', 'cui_str': 'Daily'}, {'cui': 'C0376558', 'cui_str': 'Life'}, {'cui': 'C0877248', 'cui_str': 'Adverse event'}]",12.0,0.0450163,"Unfocused extracorporeal shockwave therapy is a safe treatment, but no increase in bone mass on the forearm was found at 0.3 mJ/mm 2  energy flux density.","[{'ForeName': 'Marianne K E', 'Initials': 'MKE', 'LastName': 'Koolen', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedics, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands. m.k.e.koolen@umcutrecht.nl.'}, {'ForeName': 'Moyo C', 'Initials': 'MC', 'LastName': 'Kruyt', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedics, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}, {'ForeName': 'Fetullah C', 'Initials': 'FC', 'LastName': 'Öner', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedics, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}, {'ForeName': 'Wolfgang', 'Initials': 'W', 'LastName': 'Schaden', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Traumatology, AUVA Trauma Center Meidling, Vienna, Austria.'}, {'ForeName': 'Harrie', 'Initials': 'H', 'LastName': 'Weinans', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedics, University Medical Centre Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}, {'ForeName': 'Olav P', 'Initials': 'OP', 'LastName': 'van der Jagt', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Orthopaedics, Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital, Tilburg, The Netherlands.'}]",Archives of osteoporosis,['10.1007/s11657-019-0650-x']

Fifty patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were randomly assigned to the ezetimibe/rosuvastatin 10/5 mg and rosuvastatin 20 mg groups. The primary outcome was the percent change in the target-to-background ratio (TBR) of the index vessel in the most diseased segment (MDS), as assessed by  18 FDG PET/CT at baseline and at 6 months.

726,32364350,Effects of kinesiology tape after enucleation of mandibular dentigerous cysts.,"Objectives


Kinesiology tape (KT) creates a pulling force on the skin, thus improving blood and lymph flow by alleviating hemorrhage and congestion of lymphatic fluid. The authors hypothesized that the use of KT could be beneficial for the management of complications after head and neck surgery and designed this study to evaluate the effects of KT on swelling, pain, and trismus after enucleation of mandibular dentigerous cysts with third molar extraction.
Materials and Methods


Forty patients who underwent enucleation of a dentigerous cyst with extraction of the mandibular third molar were selected. The patients were randomized into two groups (n=20 each): a KT group, where KT was applied after surgery in addition to basic postoperative care, and a control group, where patients received basic postoperative care without KT application. Swelling, pain, and trismus were evaluated before surgery (T0) and on postoperative days 1 (T1), 2 (T2), and 3 (T3). Cyst volume, gauze weight for assessing bleeding, and operation time were recorded.
Results


There was a significant difference between the two groups in the change in swelling up to T1 and the change in swelling between T1 and T2. The maximum swelling in the KT group was significantly less than that in the No-KT group and maximum swelling appeared faster in the KT group than in the No-KT group. Both groups showed a mild pain response but there was no significant difference between the two groups. There was no significant difference on interincisal distance change between the two groups. There were no correlations between cyst volume, bleeding, operation time, and maximum swelling.
Conclusion


KT can effectively manage facial swelling after oral and maxillofacial surgeries such as cyst enucleation and third molar extraction, thus improving postoperative patient satisfaction levels and quality of life.",2020,There was a significant difference between the two groups in the change in swelling up to T1 and the change in swelling between T1 and T2.,"['Forty patients who underwent enucleation of a dentigerous cyst with extraction of the mandibular third molar were selected', 'mandibular dentigerous cysts']","['basic postoperative care without KT application', 'Kinesiology tape (KT', 'KT', 'kinesiology tape']","['facial swelling', 'change in swelling up to T1 and the change in swelling', 'maximum swelling', 'mild pain response', 'postoperative patient satisfaction levels and quality of life', 'cyst volume, bleeding, operation time, and maximum swelling', 'swelling, pain, and trismus', 'Swelling, pain, and trismus', 'interincisal distance change', 'Cyst volume, gauze weight for assessing bleeding, and operation time']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0014392', 'cui_str': 'Enucleation'}, {'cui': 'C0011428', 'cui_str': 'Dentigerous cyst'}, {'cui': 'C0185115', 'cui_str': 'Extraction'}, {'cui': 'C0024687', 'cui_str': 'Bone structure of mandible'}, {'cui': 'C0026369', 'cui_str': 'Structure of wisdom tooth'}]","[{'cui': 'C0178499', 'cui_str': 'Base'}, {'cui': 'C0032786', 'cui_str': 'Postoperative care'}, {'cui': 'C0343138', 'cui_str': 'Strapping procedure'}, {'cui': 'C0185125', 'cui_str': 'Application'}]","[{'cui': 'C0151602', 'cui_str': 'Facial swelling'}, {'cui': 'C0392747', 'cui_str': 'Changing'}, {'cui': 'C0038999', 'cui_str': 'Swelling'}, {'cui': 'C0547043', 'cui_str': 'Up'}, {'cui': 'C0025320', 'cui_str': 'Menopause'}, {'cui': 'C0806909', 'cui_str': 'Max'}, {'cui': 'C0278138', 'cui_str': 'Mild pain'}, {'cui': 'C0032790', 'cui_str': 'Postoperative period'}, {'cui': 'C0030702', 'cui_str': 'Client satisfaction'}, {'cui': 'C0441889', 'cui_str': 'Levels'}, {'cui': 'C0518214', 'cui_str': 'Quality of life satisfaction'}, {'cui': 'C0010709', 'cui_str': 'Cyst'}, {'cui': 'C0449468', 'cui_str': 'Volume'}, {'cui': 'C0019080', 'cui_str': 'Hemorrhage'}, {'cui': 'C0038895', 'cui_str': 'operative procedures'}, {'cui': 'C0040223', 'cui_str': 'Time'}, {'cui': 'C0030193', 'cui_str': 'Pain'}, {'cui': 'C0041105', 'cui_str': 'Trismus'}, {'cui': 'C0012751', 'cui_str': 'Distance'}, {'cui': 'C0037400', 'cui_str': 'Social Change'}, {'cui': 'C0590323', 'cui_str': 'Gauzes'}, {'cui': 'C0005910', 'cui_str': 'Body weight'}]",40.0,0.0448326,There was a significant difference between the two groups in the change in swelling up to T1 and the change in swelling between T1 and T2.,"[{'ForeName': 'Min-Gyu', 'Initials': 'MG', 'LastName': 'Kim', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, College of Dentistry, Dankook University, Cheonan, Korea.'}, {'ForeName': 'Moon-Young', 'Initials': 'MY', 'LastName': 'Kim', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, College of Dentistry, Dankook University, Cheonan, Korea.'}]",Journal of the Korean Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,['10.5125/jkaoms.2020.46.2.108']
727,32364506,A Persuasive mHealth Behavioral Change Intervention for Promoting Physical Activity in the Workplace: Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND


Employees in an office setting are more likely to remain physically inactive. Physical inactivity has become one of the major barriers to overcoming the risk factors for anxiety, depression, coronary heart disease, certain cancers, and type 2 diabetes. Currently, there is a gap in mobile health (mHealth) apps to promote physical activity (PA) for workers in the workplace. Studies on behavior change theories have concluded that health apps generally lack the use of theoretical constructs.
OBJECTIVE


The objective of this study was to study the feasibility of a persuasive app aimed at encouraging PA among employees and to understand the motivational aspects behind the implementation of mHealth apps among office workers.
METHODS


A 4-week study using a mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative) design was conducted with office-based employees in cities in 4 countries: Oulu, Finland; Carlow, Ireland; London, United Kingdom; and Dhaka, Bangladesh. Of the 220 invited participants (experimental group, n=115; control group, n=105), 84 participated (experimental group, n=56; control group, n=28), consisting of working-age volunteers working in an office setting. Participants used 2 different interventions: The experimental group used an mHealth app for PA motivation, and the control group used a paper diary. The purpose was to motivate employees to engage in healthier behavior regarding the promotion of PA in the workplace. A user-centered design process was followed to design, develop, and evaluate the mHealth app, incorporating self-determination theory (SDT) and using game elements. The paper diary had no specific theory-driven approach, design technique, nor game elements.
RESULTS


Compliance with app usage remained relatively low, with 27 participants (experimental group, n=20; control group, n=7) completing the study. The results support the original hypothesis that the mHealth app would help increase PA (ie, promoting daily walking in the workplace) in comparison to a paper diary (P=.033). The mHealth app supported 2 of the basic SDT psychological needs, namely autonomy (P=.004) and competence (P=.014), but not the needs of relatedness (P=.535).
CONCLUSIONS


The SDT-based mHealth application motivated employees to increase their PA in the workplace. However, compliance with app usage remained low. Future research should further develop the app based on user feedback and test it in a larger sample.",2020,"The mHealth app supported 2 of the basic SDT psychological needs, namely autonomy (P=.004) and competence (P=.014), but not the needs of relatedness (P=.535).

Sleep was assessed (via WatchPAT) and questionnaires collected before sleep and upon waking the morning after. There was no difference in apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) between the ER/DS (77 ± 20 events/h) or sham mask (84 ± 27 events/h;  p  = 0.57). In addition, there was no alleviation of headache scores, improvement in sleep quality, or acute mountain sickness symptom severity. Both the sham and ER/DS masks were poorly tolerated (∼50% subject noncompliance in both groups).

729,32364838,Effects of Silicone Hydrocoated Double Loop Ureteral Stent on Symptoms and Quality of Life in Patients Undergoing Flexible Ureteroscopy for Kidney Stone: A Randomized Multicentre Clinical Study.,"PURPOSE


To compare the hydrocoated silicone stent (Coloplast Imajin® hydro) to Percuflex TM  Plus stent (Boston Scientific) in terms of patient comfort and quality of life after flexible ureteroscopy (fURS) for stone disease over a 5-week prospective follow-up.Materials and Methdos:This is a multicenter, single-blind, prospective, randomized trial of 141 patients treated with fURS for renal stones. Primary outcome was USSQ Body Pain Index recorded before DJ removal at day 20 (D20). Secondary endpoints were USSQ scores at intermediate dates (D2, D7, D20) and 2 weeks after stent withdrawal (D35), occurrence of adverse events and stent encrustation.
RESULTS


The trial was completed by 113 (80.1%) patients. Mean (SD) USSQ body pain scores were 25% lower at D20 for the silicone stent: 18.7 (11.4) vs 25.1 (14.2), p=0.015. No difference in term of adverse events and safety profile was observed. USSQ urinary symptoms scores at D2, D7 and D20 were lower in the silicone stent group: 26.4 (7.7) vs 31.8 (8.1) at D20 p<0.001. The use of USSQ self-questionnaires was associated with a limited number of missing or incomplete answers.
CONCLUSIONS


The primary results of this large sample prospective randomized controlled study comparing the silicone Imajin® hydro stents to the Percuflex TM  Plus stent show that silicone stents are associated with significantly less patient discomfort. We would recommend their use in patients who require stenting for stone disease.Patient Summary:In this randomized prospective trial, silicone DJ stents Imajin® hydro result in lower pain and discomfort following flexible ureteroscopy as compared to Percuflex TM  Plus.",2020,Imajin® hydro result in lower pain and discomfort following flexible ureteroscopy as compared to Percuflex TM  ,"['patients who require stenting for stone disease', '141 patients treated with fURS for renal stones', 'Patients Undergoing Flexible Ureteroscopy for Kidney Stone']","['silicone DJ stents', 'flexible ureteroscopy (fURS', 'hydrocoated silicone stent (Coloplast Imajin® hydro) to Percuflex TM  Plus stent (Boston Scientific', 'flexible ureteroscopy', 'Materials and Methdos', 'Silicone Hydrocoated Double Loop Ureteral Stent', 'silicone Imajin® hydro stents', 'Percuflex TM']","['USSQ Body Pain Index recorded before DJ removal at day 20 (D20', 'Symptoms and Quality of Life', 'USSQ scores at intermediate dates (D2, D7, D20) and 2 weeks after stent withdrawal (D35), occurrence of adverse events and stent encrustation', 'patient discomfort', 'Mean (SD) USSQ body pain scores', 'USSQ urinary symptoms scores at D2, D7 and D20', 'pain and discomfort', 'adverse events and safety profile']","[{'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0038257', 'cui_str': 'Stent'}, {'cui': 'C0006736', 'cui_str': 'Calculus'}, {'cui': 'C0012634', 'cui_str': 'Disease'}, {'cui': 'C4517572', 'cui_str': '141'}, {'cui': 'C0332293', 'cui_str': 'Treated with'}, {'cui': 'C0022650', 'cui_str': 'Kidney stone'}, {'cui': 'C0443220', 'cui_str': 'Flexible'}, {'cui': 'C0194261', 'cui_str': 'Ureteroscopy'}]","[{'cui': 'C0037114', 'cui_str': 'Silicones'}, {'cui': 'C0038257', 'cui_str': 'Stent'}, {'cui': 'C0443220', 'cui_str': 'Flexible'}, {'cui': 'C0194261', 'cui_str': 'Ureteroscopy'}, {'cui': 'C0070387', 'cui_str': 'percuflex TM'}, {'cui': 'C0332287', 'cui_str': 'With'}, {'cui': 'C0006037', 'cui_str': 'Boston'}, {'cui': 'C0036397', 'cui_str': 'Science'}, {'cui': 'C0520510', 'cui_str': 'Material'}, {'cui': 'C0205173', 'cui_str': 'Double'}, {'cui': 'C0445022', 'cui_str': 'Loop'}, {'cui': 'C0183518', 'cui_str': 'Ureteric stent'}]","[{'cui': 'C0152338', 'cui_str': 'Structure of body of caudate nucleus'}, {'cui': 'C0030193', 'cui_str': 'Pain'}, {'cui': 'C0600653', 'cui_str': 'Indexes'}, {'cui': 'C0034869', 'cui_str': 'Records as Topic'}, {'cui': 'C0015252', 'cui_str': 'Removal'}, {'cui': 'C0332173', 'cui_str': 'Daily'}, {'cui': 'C0683368', 'cui_str': 'symptoms'}, {'cui': 'C0518214', 'cui_str': 'Quality of life satisfaction'}, {'cui': 'C0449820', 'cui_str': 'Score'}, {'cui': 'C0205103', 'cui_str': 'Intermediate'}, {'cui': 'C0011008', 'cui_str': 'Date'}, {'cui': 'C0439230', 'cui_str': 'week'}, {'cui': 'C0038257', 'cui_str': 'Stent'}, {'cui': 'C0152128', 'cui_str': 'Drug withdrawal'}, {'cui': 'C0243132', 'cui_str': 'occurrence'}, {'cui': 'C0877248', 'cui_str': 'Adverse event'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C2364135', 'cui_str': 'Discomfort'}, {'cui': 'C0444504', 'cui_str': 'Mean'}, {'cui': 'C0582148', 'cui_str': 'Pain score'}, {'cui': 'C0426359', 'cui_str': 'Urinary symptoms'}, {'cui': 'C0036043', 'cui_str': 'Safety'}]",141.0,0.171524,Imajin® hydro result in lower pain and discomfort following flexible ureteroscopy as compared to Percuflex TM  ,"[{'ForeName': 'Oliver', 'Initials': 'O', 'LastName': 'Wiseman', 'Affiliation': ""Urology Department, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK.""}, {'ForeName': 'Eugenio', 'Initials': 'E', 'LastName': 'Ventimiglia', 'Affiliation': 'Division of Experimental Oncology/Unit of Urology; URI; IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.'}, {'ForeName': 'Steeve', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Doizi', 'Affiliation': ""Sorbonne Université, Service d'Urologie, AP-HP, Hôpital Tenon, Paris, France.""}, {'ForeName': 'François', 'Initials': 'F', 'LastName': 'Kleinclauss', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Urology and Renal Transplantation, CHRU Besancon, Besancon, France.'}, {'ForeName': 'Julien', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Letendre', 'Affiliation': 'Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Urology, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jonathan', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Cloutier', 'Affiliation': 'University Hospital Centre of Quebec City, Urology, Quebec, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'ForeName': 'Olivier', 'Initials': 'O', 'LastName': 'Traxer', 'Affiliation': ""Sorbonne Université, Service d'Urologie, AP-HP, Hôpital Tenon, Paris, France.""}]",The Journal of urology,['10.1097/JU.0000000000001098']
730,32364879,Pro-Con Perspectives on Ethics in Surgical Research: Update from the 39th Annual Surgical Infection Society Meeting.,"Background:  Surgical research is potentially invasive, high-risk, and costly. Research that advances medical dogma must justify both its ends and its means. Although ethical questions do not always have simple answers, it is critically important for the clinician, researcher, and patient to approach these dilemmas and surgical research in a thoughtful, conscientious manner.  Methods:  We present four ethical issues in surgical research and discuss the opposing viewpoints. These topics were presented and discussed at the 39th Annual Meeting of the Surgical Infection Society as pro-con debates. The presenters of each opinion developed a succinct summary of their respective reviews for this publication.  Results:  The key subjects for these pro-con debates were: (1) Should patients be enrolled for time-sensitive surgical infection research using an opt-out or an opt-in strategy? (2) Should patients who are being enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing surgery with a non-operative intervention pay the costs of their treatment arm? (3) Should the scientific community embrace open access journals as the future of scientific publishing? (4) Should the majority of funding go to clinical or basic science research? Important points were illustrated in each of the pro-con presentations and illustrated the difficulties that are facing the performance and payment of infection research in the future.  Conclusions:  Surgical research is ethically complex, with conflicting demands between individual patients, society, and healthcare economics. At present, there are no clear answers to these and the many other ethical issues facing research in the future. Answers will only come from continued robust dialogue among all stakeholders in surgical research.",2020,Important points were illustrated in each of the pro-con presentations and illustrated the difficulties that are facing the performance and payment of infection research in the future.  ,['Surgical Research'],[],[],"[{'cui': 'C0543467', 'cui_str': 'Surgery'}, {'cui': 'C0242481', 'cui_str': 'Research Activities'}]",[],[],4.0,0.0241724,Important points were illustrated in each of the pro-con presentations and illustrated the difficulties that are facing the performance and payment of infection research in the future.  ,"[{'ForeName': 'Vanessa P', 'Initials': 'VP', 'LastName': 'Ho', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, MetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Evelyn I', 'Initials': 'EI', 'LastName': 'Truong', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, MetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Saira', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Nisar', 'Affiliation': 'The Burn Center, Medstar Washington Hospital Center, Department of Surgery, Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, DC, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Addison K', 'Initials': 'AK', 'LastName': 'May', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, Carolinas Medical Center, Atrium Health, Charlotte, North Carolina, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Gregory J', 'Initials': 'GJ', 'LastName': 'Beilman', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Donald E', 'Initials': 'DE', 'LastName': 'Fry', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Philip S', 'Initials': 'PS', 'LastName': 'Barie', 'Affiliation': 'Departments of Surgery and Public Health, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jared M', 'Initials': 'JM', 'LastName': 'Huston', 'Affiliation': 'Departments of Surgery and Science Education, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, New York, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Jeffrey W', 'Initials': 'JW', 'LastName': 'Shupp', 'Affiliation': 'The Burn Center, Medstar Washington Hospital Center, Department of Surgery, Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, DC, USA.'}, {'ForeName': 'Fredric M', 'Initials': 'FM', 'LastName': 'Pieracci', 'Affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, Denver Health Medical Center/University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, Colorado, USA.'}]",Surgical infections,['10.1089/sur.2020.098']
731,32365242,"Non-invasive clinical and microscopic evaluation of the response to treatment with clobetasol cream versus calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate foam in mild to moderate plaque psoriasis: an investigator-initiated, phase IV, unicentric, open, randomized clinical trial.","BACKGROUND


Treatment response for psoriasis is typically evaluated using clinical scores. However, patients can relapse after clinical clearance, suggesting persistent inflammation. Dermoscopy, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) can non-invasively improve treatment response assessment.
OBJECTIVES


To compare the clinical and non-invasive microscopic features in a psoriatic target lesion treated with clobetasol cream or calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate foam (Cal/BD-foam) METHODS: Prospective, unicentric, open, randomized clinical trial comparing clinical data (total clinical score [TCS]) and microscopic data (dermoscopy, RCM, OCT) in psoriasis patients treated with clobetasol or Cal/BD-foam.
RESULTS


We included 36 adult patients (22 men). At week 4, more patients treated with Cal/BD foam achieved TCS≤1 than with clobetasol (63.2% vs 18.8%, p=0.016). Treatment satisfaction was higher with Cal/BD-foam (p<0.03). Microscopically, Cal/BD-foam induced more reduction of epidermal thickness at week 4 (p<0.049). Dilated horizontal blood vessels were more common with clobetasol than with Cal/BD-foam at week 8 (69.2% vs 31.2%, p=0.159). If epidermal hyperplasia was noted at baseline, the response was poorer with clobetasol (p=0.029).
LIMITATIONS


Small sample size, open study, imaging sampling bias.
CONCLUSION


Cal/BD-foam is more effective than clobetasol, has better patient satisfaction and induces greater reduction of the hyperkeratosis/acanthosis, regardless of baseline epidermal hyperplasia.",2020,"Microscopically, Cal/BD-foam induced more reduction of epidermal thickness at week 4 (p<0.049).","['mild to moderate plaque psoriasis', '36 adult patients (22 men', 'psoriasis patients treated with clobetasol or Cal/BD-foam']","['clobetasol cream versus calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate foam', 'clobetasol cream or calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate foam']","['Dilated horizontal blood vessels', 'microscopic data (dermoscopy, RCM, OCT', 'Treatment satisfaction', 'Dermoscopy, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT', 'reduction of epidermal thickness', 'epidermal hyperplasia']","[{'cui': 'C1299392', 'cui_str': 'Mild to moderate'}, {'cui': 'C0406317', 'cui_str': 'Chronic small plaque psoriasis'}, {'cui': 'C0001675', 'cui_str': 'Adult'}, {'cui': 'C0030705', 'cui_str': 'Patient'}, {'cui': 'C0025266', 'cui_str': 'Man'}, {'cui': 'C0033860', 'cui_str': 'Psoriasis'}, {'cui': 'C0332293', 'cui_str': 'Treated with'}, {'cui': 'C0008992', 'cui_str': 'Clobetasol'}, {'cui': 'C0439259', 'cui_str': 'kcal'}, {'cui': 'C0991510', 'cui_str': 'Foam'}]","[{'cui': 'C0008992', 'cui_str': 'Clobetasol'}, {'cui': 'C0700385', 'cui_str': 'Cream'}, {'cui': 'C0065767', 'cui_str': 'calcipotriene'}, {'cui': 'C0053523', 'cui_str': 'Betamethasone dipropionate'}, {'cui': 'C0991510', 'cui_str': 'Foam'}]","[{'cui': 'C0700124', 'cui_str': 'Ectatic'}, {'cui': 'C0205126', 'cui_str': 'Horizontal'}, {'cui': 'C0005847', 'cui_str': 'Blood vessel structure'}, {'cui': 'C0205288', 'cui_str': 'Microscopic'}, {'cui': 'C1449565', 'cui_str': 'Dermatoscopy'}, {'cui': 'C0242842', 'cui_str': 'Confocal Microscopy'}, {'cui': 'C0920367', 'cui_str': 'Optical coherence tomography'}, {'cui': 'C0039798', 'cui_str': 'therapy'}, {'cui': 'C0242428', 'cui_str': 'Satisfaction'}, {'cui': 'C0301630', 'cui_str': 'Reduction (chemical)'}, {'cui': 'C0014520', 'cui_str': 'Epidermis structure'}, {'cui': 'C1280412', 'cui_str': 'Thick'}, {'cui': 'C0263641', 'cui_str': 'Epithelial hyperplasia of skin'}]",36.0,0.0802139,"Microscopically, Cal/BD-foam induced more reduction of epidermal thickness at week 4 (p<0.049).","[{'ForeName': 'O', 'Initials': 'O', 'LastName': 'Yélamos', 'Affiliation': ""Dermatology Department, Hospital Clínic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'ForeName': 'B', 'Initials': 'B', 'LastName': 'Alejo', 'Affiliation': ""Dermatology Department, Hospital Clínic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'ForeName': 'S Seda', 'Initials': 'SS', 'LastName': 'Ertekin', 'Affiliation': ""Dermatology Department, Hospital Clínic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'ForeName': 'L', 'Initials': 'L', 'LastName': 'Villa-Crespo', 'Affiliation': ""Dermatology Department, Hospital Clínic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'ForeName': 'S', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Zamora-Barquero', 'Affiliation': ""Dermatology Department, Hospital Clínic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'ForeName': 'N', 'Initials': 'N', 'LastName': 'Martinez', 'Affiliation': ""Dermatology Department, Hospital Clínic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'ForeName': 'M', 'Initials': 'M', 'LastName': 'Domínguez', 'Affiliation': ""Dermatology Department, Hospital Clínic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'ForeName': 'P', 'Initials': 'P', 'LastName': 'Iglesias', 'Affiliation': ""Dermatology Department, Hospital Clínic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'ForeName': 'A', 'Initials': 'A', 'LastName': 'Herrero', 'Affiliation': ""Dermatology Department, Hospital Clínic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'ForeName': 'J', 'Initials': 'J', 'LastName': 'Malvehy', 'Affiliation': ""Dermatology Department, Hospital Clínic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'ForeName': 'S', 'Initials': 'S', 'LastName': 'Puig', 'Affiliation': ""Dermatology Department, Hospital Clínic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}]",Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,['10.1111/jdv.16559']
732,32365251,Secukinumab maintains superiority over ustekinumab in clearing skin and improving quality of life in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis: 52-week results from a double-blind phase 3b trial (CLARITY).,"BACKGROUND


Secukinumab demonstrated superior efficacy over ustekinumab in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis over 16 weeks in the CLARITY study and over 52 weeks in the CLEAR study.
OBJECTIVE


To compare the efficacy and safety of secukinumab vs ustekinumab over 52 weeks in CLARITY.
METHODS


Analysis of 52-week data from CLARITY (NCT02826603), a phase 3b study in which patients were randomized to receive secukinumab 300 mg (n = 550) or ustekinumab 45/90 mg (n = 552) per label.
RESULTS


At week 52, secukinumab was superior to ustekinumab in the proportion of patients who achieved ≥90% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (73.2% vs 59.8%; odds ratio [OR], 1.84 [95% CI, 1.41-2.41]; P < .0001), Investigator's Global Assessment modified 2011 responses of clear (0) or almost clear (1) skin (76.0% vs 60.2%; OR, 2.12 [95% CI, 1.61-2.79]; P < .0001), and Dermatology Life Quality Index response of no effect (0/1) (69.9% vs 61.2%; P = .0028). Proportions of patients with any adverse events were comparable between treatment arms.

734,32365303,Addition of pectin-alginate to a carbohydrate beverage does not maintain gastrointestinal barrier function during exercise in hot-humid conditions better than carbohydrate ingestion alone.,"PURPOSE


To compare the effects of consuming a 16% maltodextrin+fructose+pectin alginate (MAL+FRU+PEC+ALG) drink against a nutrient matched maltodextrin-fructose (MAL+FRU) drink on enterocyte damage and gastrointestinal permeability after cycling in hot and humid conditions.
METHODS


Fourteen recreational cyclists (7 men) completed three experimental trials in a randomized placebo-controlled design. Participants cycled for 90 min (45% VO2max) and completed a 15 min time-trial in hot (32°C) humid (70% relative humidity) conditions. Every 15-minutes cyclists consumed 143 mL of either (1) water; (2) MAL+FRU+PEC+ALG (90g CHO.hr/16% w/v), (3) - a ratio-matched MAL+FRU drink also (90g CHO.hr/16% w/v). Blood was sampled before and after exercise and gastrointestinal (GI) permeability determined by serum measurements of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (IFABP) and the percent ratio of lactulose (5g) to rhamnose (2g) recovered in post-exercise urine.
RESULTS


Compared to WATER, IFABP decreased by 349±67pg.mL-1 with MAL+FRU+PEC+ALG (p=0.007), and by 427±56pg.mL-1 with MAL+FRU (p=0.02). GI permeability was reduced in both the MAL+FRU+PEC+ALG (by 0.019±0.01, p = 0.0003) and MAL+FRU (by 0.014±0.01, p = 0.002) conditions relative to WATER.
CONCLUSION


Both CHO beverages attenuated GI barrier damage to a similar extent relative to water. No metabolic, cardiovascular, thermoregulatory or performance differences were observed between the CHO beverages.

735,32365314,Effectiveness of Nighttime Orthoses in Controlling Pain for Women With Hand Osteoarthritis: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"IMPORTANCE


Hand osteoarthritis is a musculoskeletal problem that is associated with hand pain, stiffness, functional limitation, decreased grip strength, and reduced quality of life.
OBJECTIVE


To evaluate the effectiveness of nighttime orthoses on the second or third finger of the dominant hand in controlling pain in women with symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) in the interphalangeal joint.
DESIGN


Randomized controlled trial.
SETTING


Outpatient clinic.
PARTICIPANTS


Fifty-two women with symptomatic OA and presence of Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes, allocated randomly to the intervention group or the control group.
INTERVENTION


The intervention group used a nighttime orthosis on the second or third finger of the dominant hand. Both groups participated in an educational session.
OUTCOMES AND MEASURES


The following parameters were measured: pain (numerical rating scale, Australian/Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index), grip and pinch strength, function (Cochin Hand Functional Scale), and manual performance (Moberg Pick Up Test).
RESULTS


The intervention group showed a statistically significant improvement in pain (p < .001) and hand function. The improvement in pain correlated with Cochin Hand Functional Scale scores and the absence of Bouchard's nodes in the third finger, which are predictors of the best prognosis for treatment with a nighttime orthosis.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE


This study demonstrates that nighttime orthoses are effective in reducing pain and lead to improvement in hand function in women with hand OA. They are therefore specifically recommended for nonpharmacological treatment of hand OA.
WHAT THIS ARTICLE ADDS


Orthoses can be considered, together with manual exercises and joint protection, as an intervention to reduce symptoms and improve hand function in people with hand OA.

736,32365355,L-Thyroxine Therapy for Older Adults With Subclinical Hypothyroidism and Hypothyroid Symptoms: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Trial.,"Background


L-thyroxine does not improve hypothyroid symptoms among adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). However, those with greater symptom burden before treatment may still benefit.
Objective


To determine whether L-thyroxine improves hypothyroid symptoms and tiredness among older adults with SCH and greater symptom burden.
Design


Secondary analysis of the randomized, placebo-controlled trial TRUST (Thyroid Hormone Replacement for Untreated Older Adults with Subclinical Hypothyroidism Trial). (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01660126).
Setting


Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Scotland.
Participants


638 persons aged 65 years or older with persistent SCH (thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 4.60 to 19.9 mIU/L for >3 months and normal free thyroxine level) and complete outcome data.
Intervention


L-thyroxine or matching placebo with mock dose titration.
Measurements


1-year change in Hypothyroid Symptoms and Tiredness scores (range, 0 to 100; higher scores indicate more symptoms) on the Thyroid-Related Quality-of-Life Patient-Reported Outcome Questionnaire among participants with high symptom burden (baseline Hypothyroid Symptoms score >30 or Tiredness score >40) versus lower symptom burden.
Results


132 participants had Hypothyroid Symptoms scores greater than 30, and 133 had Tiredness scores greater than 40. Among the group with high symptom burden, the Hypothyroid Symptoms score improved similarly between those receiving L-thyroxine (mean within-group change, -12.3 [95% CI, -16.6 to -8.0]) and those receiving placebo (mean within-group change, -10.4 [CI, -15.3 to -5.4]) at 1 year; the adjusted between-group difference was -2.0 (CI, -5.5 to 1.5; P = 0.27). Improvements in Tiredness scores were also similar between those receiving L-thyroxine (mean within-group change, -8.9 [CI, -14.5 to -3.3]) and those receiving placebo (mean within-group change, -10.9 [CI, -16.0 to -5.8]); the adjusted between-group difference was 0.0 (CI, -4.1 to 4.0; P = 0.99). There was no evidence that baseline Hypothyroid Symptoms score or Tiredness score modified the effects of L-thyroxine versus placebo (P for interaction = 0.20 and 0.82, respectively).
Limitation


Post hoc analysis, small sample size, and examination of only patients with 1-year outcome data.
Conclusion


In older adults with SCH and high symptom burden at baseline, L-thyroxine did not improve hypothyroid symptoms or tiredness compared with placebo.

737,32365359,"Rifabutin-Based Triple Therapy (RHB-105) for Helicobacter pylori Eradication: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Controlled Trial.","Background


Although consensus supports eradication of Helicobacter pylori infections, antimicrobial resistance has substantially reduced eradication rates with most current therapies.
Objective


To assess the effectiveness of a novel rifabutin-based therapy (RHB-105) for H pylori eradication.
Design


Phase 3, double-blind trial (ERADICATE Hp2). (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03198507).
Setting


55 clinical research sites in the United States.
Participants


455 treatment-naive adults with epigastric discomfort and confirmed H pylori infection.
Intervention


RHB-105 (amoxicillin, 3 g; omeprazole, 120 mg; and rifabutin, 150 mg) versus active comparator (amoxicillin, 3 g, and omeprazole, 120 mg), given as 4 capsules every 8 hours for 14 days.
Measurements


Between-group difference for H pylori eradication rate, demonstrated by 13C urea breath test 4 weeks after treatment, analyzed by using the χ2 test.
Results


In the intention-to-treat population, the eradication rate was higher with RHB-105 than with the active comparator (228 vs. 227 patients, respectively; 83.8% [95% CI, 78.4% to 88.0%] vs. 57.7% [95% CI, 51.2% to 64.0%]; P < 0.001). Eradication rates were unaffected by resistance to clarithromycin or metronidazole. No rifabutin resistance was detected. The most commonly reported adverse events (incidence ≥5%) were diarrhea (10.1% with RHB-105 vs. 7.9% with active comparator), headache (7.5% vs. 7.0%), and nausea (4.8% vs. 5.3%).
Limitation


Persons of Asian descent were excluded because of their higher prevalence of poor cytochrome P450 2C19 metabolizers.
Conclusion


These findings suggest potential for RHB-105 as first-line empirical H pylori therapy, addressing an unmet need in the current environment of increasing antibiotic resistance.
